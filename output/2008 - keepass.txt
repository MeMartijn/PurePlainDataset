KeePass Password Safe is a small system that can be easily transferred from computer to computer by a simple USB stick. Its purpose is to solve a problem that really bothers many people today when they have to choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be secure or to use every time the same one so they won’t forget it but risk be found out by others. So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them. That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password and/or key file. There are no duplicates, anywhere in your computer, of this Master Password and/or key file so in case of lost database cannot be opened by anyone. Not even by you and that is because there is no recovery password or back door. KeePass Password Safe beside security also provides you with several functionalities in order to keep your database organized and up to date. Those are analyzed in the following pages. More about KeePass you can find out at http://keepass.info/
More about KeePass can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/ In this website you can find out more about the project and discuss any questions in the forums. You can go back and look at previous releases, code and problems that have been solved. There you can also find information about the developers as well as the project’s main characteristics such as programming language and algorithms; http://keepass.info/ This is project’s official website where you can find links to all above and also find features available for downloading such as language translations and plug-ins.
KeePass consists of a database which contains data for one or more users. Each user’s data are divided into groups and subgroups so that they are organized in a form that serves right the user. Every user has a unique Master Key which can be simple or composite and its combination opens uniquely the database. If lost there is no recovery. Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent or copied to websites, application and accounts. There is also the ability for a onetime key creation to be used once in a transaction without the risk of reused by others for any reason. In the diagram below there are the main components of the system, subsystem interconnections and external interfaces to help you understand the main idea of KeePass. All of them are analyzed with more details in this document.
KeePass Password Safe provides the user with the following functions: Database – New, Open, Close, Save, Print, Search, Import, Export User can create a new database locked by a Master Key. The database can be opened and closed whenever user wants it. Changes on the data are permitted and the changes can be saved. The user also can print all data in order to keep them with him even when a computer is not available. Also the user can search the database using key words through a search engine provided with the software. Last but not least, the database can be imported and/or exported from/to the Internet; Group/Subgroup – Add, Modify, Delete, Find Data are organized in groups and subgroups in the order that user wants and finds effective. Those groups can be modified whenever. New groups and subgroups can be added easily and can be deleted the same way. The feature of searching can be applied in just one group and not in the whole database if wanted; Entry – Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup and it contains title, username, password, URL and notes. Not all fields are required for an entry. An entry can be duplicated and deleted in the click of a button; Change Language At KeePass website there are available language translations that can be downloaded and applied easily; Auto-Type The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser; Command Line Options The user can pass a file path in the command line in order for KeePass to open this file at startup; Composite Master Key To open a database you must use all key sources such as password, key file and/or Windows account details that were used when the Master Key was created. All these together form the Composite Master Key and are all required in order to open the database. So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database; Configuration This feature is used to explain how KeePass store its configuration and where. · Import/Export KeePass can support importing data from CSV files, Code Wallet, Password Safe and Personal Vault; Integration KeePass uses Global Hot Key to restore KeePass main window and Limit to single instance option to run only one instance of KeePass at a time; Password Generator There are available generations based on character sets and based on patterns the first for generating random passwords and the second for creating passwords which require specific patterns. There is also available generating passwords that follow rules which are determined further down on this document. Then there are security-reducing options which reduce the security of the passwords they are applied to. Finally there are configuring settings of automatically generated passwords for new entries so that a random password will automatically be created by KeePass when a new entry is wanted; Secure Edit Controls KeePass offers the ability for passwords and data to be appeared behind asterisks when the user wants it. When this option is turned on, secure edit controls stronger than the ones of Windows are protecting your data and no one can access them, see them or steal them; TAN Support KeePass uses TAN-Transaction Authentication Numbers for even more security. This feature can be used for generating one time passwords so that there won’t be any chance, for anyone to access e.g. your bank account even if he finds out that password. That is because when the password is entered one time it becomes useless. TANs can be added using the TANs wizard; URL Field The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined. In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports. URL field also offers the ability of executed command lines instead of URLs. Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed; Using Stored Passwords Passwords that are stored in the database can be copied to website accounts and applications with security and without retyping them again. This can be done by several methods such us Context-Sensitive Password List, Drag and Drop, Auto-Type and KeeForm. All of them are explained better further down; Lock Workspace Last but not least at all is the locking workspace feature. This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized. So to unlock it the Master Key is required again. The workspace can be locked manually as well by selecting this option from File menu.
Advanced end users: users that are familiar with programming and can personalize their database by creating auto-types, using command line options and generally can use features and maybe expand their use by adding more functions; End users/Desktop: users with no particular knowledge on computer programming. They just use the database for organizing their data and to keep them safe; System administrators: administrators working on computers that support a lot of accounts and personal data for other users. Using KeePass the administrator can save all data with no risk of leak to third persons; Science/Research Telecommunications: for organizing data that have to do with lots of people and applications; Industry: for one-time passwords that can be used for testing controls or for expired entries to gain access in particular systems and programs; Other Audience.
KeePass should run on Operating Systems: WINE, 32-bit MS Windows (95/98), 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP), All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP),Win2K, WinXP, Microsoft Windows Server 2003. The user interfaces used are: NET/Mono, Win32 (MS Windows) All new releases contain Filename Architecture Type KeePass-1.x-Setup.exe i386 .exe (32-bit Windows) KeePass-1.x-Src.zip Platform-Independent Source .zip KeePass-1.x.zip i386 .zip and release notes witch describe what has changed and what has been added. Nothing more than these is required for a fully functional KeePass. KeePass should run perfectly on older releases without any features limitations or data loss.
Timing requirements in KeePass Password Safe: When a password is copied for any reason, (e.g. copy to an application, account, and website) it remains in the memory for only 10 seconds. After 10 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you have to recopy again. That provides security in a case a password is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one can find it out by pasting later. Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe: Not in all translations translated help files and tutorials are available. Specific Technologies used in KeePass Password Safe: In order to keep the user’s data fully protected, 2 very secure algorithms are used: Cipher Block Size Key Size Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) 128 bits 256 bits Twofish 128 bits 256 bits In both algorithms every time the user saves a database, a random 128-bit initialization vector is generated; For the creation of the 256-bit key the Cipher uses, the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-256 is used; All the bytes needed for the Initialization Vector, the master key salt, etc are generated via pseudorandom sources: current tick count, performance counter, system date/time, mouse cursor position, memory status, active window focus handles, window message stack, process heap status, process startup information and several system information structures; When the KeePass is active, all passwords are stored encrypted in process memory so in order for them to be completely safe the ARC4 encryption algorithm is used, using a random 12 bytes long key.
By downloading KeePass Password Safe, the user also gets: A compiled HTML Help file with a tutorial and full help on all features provided; A KeePass Internet shortcut which take the user in the system’s official website where are available downloads, translations, plug-ins and extensions.
System features are organized by use cases and functional hierarchy so that the main functions of the system will be understandable.
This feature provides the ability to create a new database
It is the first thing a user must do to begin using KeePass. Its main function is the determination of the master password that will unlock the database from now on
Data Flow

User chooses cancel; Exit from KeePass.
Folder selected must be of type the database can read and that is “name”.kdb
This feature allows the user to save any changes or updates he has performed to his database.
When a database is opened, the user can access his passwords, organize them into new groups and subgroups, delete and add entries and so much more. But when it is time for the database to close or during his working on the database, he can save the changes made.
Data Flow
User opens KeePass and changes his data; User selects save database; Database is saved; User exits KeePass.
User selects save as; User gives a new database name; New database is saved and opens with the same master password.
User continues working after he saves the database.
User wants to exit KeePass; A message is appeared asking if he wants to save the database; User selects yes and exits, or no and exits or cancel and return to database.
Users minimizes the database; A message is appeared asking if he wants to save the database before locking.
Databases must have different names or else the previews one will be replace if selected
This feature allows user to print a selection of data that are stored in the database.
While working on the database, the user has the option to print data from his database. This can be done by selecting print. When this happens, a list of data types that can be printed are shown and the user can select the data to be printed.

REQ-18: An internet connection and a browser are required in order to download new language translations For the following features, use cases are not included
This feature allows user to define a sequence of keypresses which KeePass will automatically perform.
The user defines the sequences which can be sent to any other open window like browsers or login accounts. By default the sent keystroke sequence is {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}. There is the ability for the user to define his own auto-type sequence in the notes field of each entry. The sequence must be prefixed with “Auto-Type” and length of one line. If a sequence is more than a line it cannot be used and in case of two sequences in one note’s field only the first one is used. There are 3 methods to invoke auto-type. The first method is to use the context menu command and perform auto-type while the entry is selected; The second method is to select an entry and press Ctrl+V; The third method is to use the system-wide auto-type hot key so that KeePass can search all entries in the database for matching sequences.
The prefix “Auto-Type:” is required in front of each sequence
Sequence’s length must not be more than a line (59 characters)
If two auto-types are referred in one note field, only the first is used
This feature allows user to pass a file patch in the command line so that KeePass will open it immediately after start up.
The database file location is passed as argument in the command line. More about this feature and examples for using it can be found at help contents in KeePass
Only one database file is allowed in command line options
In case a space is found in the path, it must be enclosed into quotes
This feature is a composition of master password and key files and all its composites are required so that the database can be unlocked.
The database can be unlocked with a master password, a key file or both of them. But the same composition of them must be used always. A master key is a password the user creates. Once a master key is created for a database, it is always required. In case the user forgets it, the database can never be opened again by any way. A key file is a file that locks the database. The database opens when this file is present. If the file is lost and there are no copies of it, all data are gone forever and database never unlocks again.
If a master password is required to unlock the database, the database doesn’t open unless the password is entered
If a key file is required to unlock the database, the database doesn’t open unless the key file is present
If there is a composite key, both master password and key file are required
In case of lost master password or key file, the database never unlocks again. There is no recovery
There is no backdoor or key that unlocks all databases
This feature gives the ability to user to import/export files from/to database.
There is the ability to import data from CSV files, code wallet, password safe and password vault. There are available plug-ins which add more import capabilities and formats and those are: File format CSV and File format XML. There isn’t any standard password database format and every password manager uses its own file format. Despite that, almost all support exporting to CSV or XML files.
REQ-29: File formats are not specialized password database formats
REQ-30: File formats only specify a low-level layout of stored data
This feature allows switching back from an application to KeePass.
The global hot key takes the user back from one window to KeePass. In case of multiple databases running of KeePass the global hot key restores the window which was opened first of all. The global hot key is Ctrl+Alt+K
Global hot key cannot be changed
This feature generates random passwords.
The password generator creates random passwords every time an entry is created. This password may contain letters (big and small) and numbers. The user can keep it or he can put his own in the field. The generation can be based on character sets, patterns or can be created according by rules. This feature can be disabled if user wants it by selecting 0 as password length in the password generator dialog. More about characters sets and patterns can be found at KeePass Help Files including directions and examples.
According to restriction rules that are applied every time.
This feature allows creation of Transaction Authentication Numbers.
TANs can be passwords that provide security because they can never be used for more than once time. They can be added to user’s database by using TAN wizard and can contain all letters and numbers. When TAN are created, they appear as typical entries which in the field title contain “TAN” so that KeePass will know it’s a TAN. In TAN entries, user cannot change the title, user name or URL but notes can be added. When a TAN is used, its expiration time is set to that current time and the entry expires automatically.
Title, username or URL cannot be changed in a TAN entry.
When a TAN is used, it expires automatically and can never be used again.
User interface includes various forms and windows. The main database window consists of the main menu bar with file, edit, view, tools and help. Under main menu there is a toolbar with shortcuts to most used functions of KeePass. Those are: new, open, save, add entry, edit/view entry, delete entry, copy username to clipboard, copy password to clipboard, find in database and lock workspace. On the main database window are appeared entries from a selected group. Groups and subgroups can be found at a side bar. When a function is performed like adding, editing or deleting, the active window is the one performing the action. At this time the main database window is inactive and cannot be accessed unless the current active window is closed. KeePass as referred previously uses NET/Mono and Win32 (MS Windows) interfaces.
Internet connection and a browser are required in order for several functions to be executed such as downloading plug-ins.
When a password is copied, it remains on memory for only 10 seconds. If in the meanwhile it is not pasted anywhere, it must be copied again. That happens so that if user copies a password and not paste it anywhere, the password cannot be found by anyone later.
When a USB which contains the database is removed from a computer while changes haven’t been completely saved, the database is damaged and cannot be opened. In this case the repair functionality can help by repairing KeePass database file from tools menu. In case the user forgets or loses the Master Password, the repair functionality won’t help. In case the header of the database, which is the first few bytes, is corrupted, again the repair functionality won’t help. To avoid this kind of situations, backups can be done regularly.
KeePass is a small and light project so it does not need to be installed. All it takes is unpacking from the Zip package. It can be transferred also in a USB stick with no additional configuration needed; KeePass is a project that once uninstalled from a computer, leaves no trace behind. So there is no way passwords and other data in the database to be found later; KeePass is developed under GNU General Public License version 2 or later (copy from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) and can be distributed under those terms; KeePass can be found and downloaded from www.sourceforge.com and the project’s official website at http://keepass.info/ for free.

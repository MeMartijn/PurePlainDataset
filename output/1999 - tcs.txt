This TACTICAL CONTROL SYSTEM (TCS) - SYSTEM / SUBSYSTEM SPECIFICATION (SSS) - VERSION 1.0 identifies, specifies, and establishes the detailed system requirements for the Tactical Control System as set forth by the OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT FOR THE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) TACTICAL CONTROL SYSTEM (TCS) - VERSION 5.0. The SSS further specifies the methods to be used to ensure that each requirement has been met. Requirements pertaining to the TCS external interfaces are covered in separate Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs) to be published. The SSS is published IAW DID DI-IPSC-81431, dated 941205.
The purpose of the TCS is to provide the military services with a single command, control, data receipt, data processing, data export and dissemination system that is interoperable with the family of all present and future tactical unmanned aerial vehicles. These UAVs shall include the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) and the Medium Altitude and Endurance (MAE) UAV (henceforth referred to as Outrider and Predator respectively), their associated payloads, and other network communication systems. TCS will also be capable of receiving and processing information from High Altitude and Endurance (HAE) UAVs, their associated payloads, future development UAVs and payloads.
The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Joint Project Office (UAV JPO) has undertaken development of a TCS for UAVs. Design and development of the TCS will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 is defined as the Program Definition and Risk Reduction phase, and Phase 2 is defined as the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase in accordance with Department Of Defense Instruction (DODI) - 5000.2R. During Phase 2, TCS Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) will commence. Phase 1 will be a 24 month period and will demonstrate Level 1 through Level 5 interaction (as defined below) in an Incremental and Evolutionary strategy as described in accordance with MIL-STD-498. The five discrete levels of multiple UAV interaction to be provided by the TCS are: Level 1: receipt and transmission of secondary imagery and/or data; Level 2: direct receipt of imagery and/or data; Level 3: control of the UAV payload in addition to direct receipt of imagery/data; Level 4: control of the UAV, less launch and recovery, plus all the functions of level three; Level 5: capability to have full function and control of the UAV from takeoff to landing.
The TCS consists of the software, software-related hardware and the extra ground support hardware necessary for the control of the Outrider, and the Predator UAV, and future tactical UAVs. The TCS will also provide connectivity to specifically identified Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems. TCS will have the objective capability of receiving High Altitude Endurance (HAE) UAV payload information. Although developed as a total package, the TCS will be scaleable to meet the user's requirements for deployment. TCS will provide a common Human-Computer Interface (HCI) for tactical airborne platforms to simplify user operations, training, and facilitate seamless integration into the Services’ joint C4I infrastructure across all levels of interaction.
The major focus of the TCS program is software. The software will provide the UAV operator the necessary tools for computer related communications, mission tasking, mission planning, mission execution, data receipt, data processing, limited data exploitation, and data dissemination. The software will provide a high resolution computer generated graphical user interface that enables a UAV operator trained on one system to control different types of UAVs or UAV payloads with a minimum of additional training. The TCS will operate in an open architecture and be capable of being hosted on computers that are typically supported by the using Service. Software developed will be Defense Information Infrastructure / Common Operating Environment (DII/COE) compliant, non-proprietary, and the architectural standard for all future tactical UAVs. To the extent possible, the TCS will use standard Department of Defense (DoD) software components to achieve commonality. TCS will provide software portability, scaleable functionality, and support for operational configurations tailored to the users’ needs.
To the extent possible, the TCS will use standard DoD components in order to achieve commonality. The TCS will use the computing hardware specified by the service specific procurement contracts. The individual armed services will identify TCS computing hardware, the desired level of TCS functionality, the battlefield C4I connectivity, and the particular type of air vehicle and payloads to be operated depending upon the deployment concept and area of operations. TCS hardware must be scaleable or modular to meet varying Service needs. TCS hardware will permit long range communications from one TCS to another, data storage expansion, access to other computers to share in processing capability, and multiple external peripherals.
TCS integration with C4I systems will be accomplished through development of interfaces that permit information exchange between the TCS and specified C4I systems. TCS will be capable of entering DII/COE compliant networks.

The TCS will export and disseminate UAV imagery products, tactical communication messages, as well as mission plans and target coordinates. The TCS will also receive, process, and display tasking orders, and operational information from Service specific mission planning systems.
The TCS will be developed in compliance with the following military and commercial computing systems architecture, communications processing, and imagery architecture standards: Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) / Common Operating Environment (COE); Computer Open Systems Interface Processor (COSIP); Common Imagery Ground/Surface System (CIGSS) Handbook; Variable Message Format (VMF) and Joint Message Format (JMF); National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF); Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) (C3I) Joint Technical Architecture (JTA).

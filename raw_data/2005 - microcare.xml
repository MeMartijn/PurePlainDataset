<title>Software Requirements Specification 
For Voucher Management System </title>
<version>1.0</version>
<p id= "1">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="1.1">
<title>General overview of the VMUS (Voucher Maintenance Unit System) </title>
<text_body>
<itemize>
<item>
System Development: 
The system will be developed on Oracle 9i platform Front end will be VB 
(visual basic) Reports will be crystal reports 9 
</item>
<item>
System design: 
The system will be user friendly with maximum master table structure with 
all transaction screens to have drop down selection menus to minimize data entry errors. 
The main data entry screen on claims entry to have drop drown menu from patient’s profile 
selection to medicine cost to have drop down. Minimize the use of key board for any number 
entry to have a faster transaction data entry. The system will be easily trainable for the user 
with minimum computer skill with simple user step by step manual. 
</item>
<item>
Storage efficiency: 
The structural design of the database will have sequential links with surrogate 
keys. The database storage will be highly efficient to manage and avoid empty unused spaced 
blocked, properly defragmenter on a periodic basis. This efficiency will have a maximum 
provision to expand this program beyond the pilot period, 
if the program requirements remain same. 
</item>
<item>
Security: 
High intrusion controls will be in place in the system and the database. 
Access level controls, various organizational level user setting 
by including granular model setting. 
</item>
<item>
External Hardware interface: 
<itemize>
<item>
Bar-code – 
 the system will interface with the bar-code reader to interface all transaction 
details. E.g. voucher number verifications, claim form entry and 
selection of voucher usage by the clients.
</item>
<item>
Bio-metrics – the system will interface with the thumb-print reader for verifying claims form 
used by the clients.

<title> Purpose </title>
<text_body>The purpose of this document is to explain the flow and the requirement 
of Voucher Management System (VMU) required by Marie Stopes International Uganda
(MSIU) during the various meetings held between MSIU and Microcare from 28th of Nov 
2005 to 30th of Nov 2005. This document is purely based on the Functional Flow Diagram 
designed by Microcare. The document will explain every small 
entity of the system including various code generations, Bar-coding and Graphical User 
Interface etc. This document will help the system development team to understand the 
overall and detailed functions of every small entity in VMU and to design the system that 
will meet every requirement of the VMU program.  This document will help the testing team 
to prepare the Test Cases and will help them to test every module in the system and overall 
testing of the system, so that the testing team will have confidence on the quality of this 
system. </text_body>

<p id="1.3">
<title> Project Scope </title>
<p id="1.3.1">
<title> about MSIU and OBA Program </title>
<p id="The concept of Output-based Aid (OBA) ">
<text_body>Past experiences with development aid showed, that financing inputs, 
e.g. facilities and equipment, does not result in the necessary improvement of health 
outcomes. Thus as a change of paradigm, the OBA concept finances agreed outputs 
with predefined quality rather than pre-defined inputs by selling vouchers for STD 
services at subsidised prices to patients. These vouchers will be refunded to service 
providers in the private sector (medical doctors, qualified nurses and midwives), 
government hospitals, NGOs, and faith-based organisations.  
The major advantages of the OBA approach are, that it allows 
<itemize>
<item>To target resources to address selected health problems,</item> 
<item>To target the provision of services to specific parts of the population and </item>
<item>To stimulate private market initiative and competition. </item>  
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The approach was successfully applied in the sixties/seventies in South 
Korea and Taiwan. In recent years also a programme was run in Nicaragua but the OBA 
has not been 
implemented in larger scale programs.</text_body>
</p>
<p id="Objective of the OBA Programme in Uganda is to provide ">
<text_body>
<itemize>
<item>Quality health care services for STD treatment, </item>
<item>For the sexually active population of the Mbarara district, </item>
<item>Through a voucher system, </item>
<item>By qualified, approved providers, </item>
<item>For a pilot phase of 1 year. </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The principles of the voucher, the contents of the health care services, 
their required quality, the standards to be met by the providers and their infrastructure, 
as well as the measures for monitoring the 
quality have been defined in the PDS. </text_body>  
</p>
<p id="Basic structures and processes of the STD voucher programme ">
<text_body>The main structures and processes in the STD voucher programme are: 
<itemize>
<item>The programme is prepared, implemented and managed by the Voucher 
Management Unit (VMU). </item>
<item>The VMU establishes a network of approved providers (during the pilot phase private,
 NGO, FBO providers) 
throughout Mbarara District. </item>
<item>The VMU runs a marketing and behavioural change campaign (BCC) to market and inform about the
 voucher services and how to use them. </item>
<item>The VMU establishes and runs a distribution system with the purpose
 to distribute the STD vouchers to the sexually active population for which the 
above-mentioned providers are in reach.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>Distribution follows certain rules: 
<itemize>
<item>The vouchers are packed in two with one voucher for the purchaser of the voucher, 
in the following addressed as “client” 
and one for the partner of the client. </item>
<item>The voucher may only be bought for personal treatment or for the treatment 
of the partner. Only one voucher is sold at time. The option of selling more than one 
voucher 
to a person at a time introduces too many sources for fraud. </item>
<item>Distributors keep a distribution list documenting distributor, voucher number, 
date, place of sale, and 
name and place of living of the customer. </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The client may honour the voucher at any approved provider of his choice.  
STD treatment according to the National Treatment Algorithms for STD in Uganda (NTA), 
adapted for this voucher scheme (TA-OBA, treatment algorithms for STD treatment in the 
OBA scheme), 
is given to clients for free for the syndromes of 
<itemize>
<item>Urethral discharge </item>
<item>Abnormal vaginal discharge </item>
<item>Genital ulcer </item>
<item>Inguinal bubo </item>
<item>Ophthalmia neonatorum </item>
<item>Acute scrotal swelling </item>
<item> Pelvic inflammatory disease </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>In line with the NTA the voucher includes
<itemize>
<item>First consultation with basic lab testing and treatment </item>   
<item>First follow-up visit for all clients. If symptoms persist drug regimen will be switched</item>
<item> If necessary second follow-up visit. If symptoms persist referral to a hospital. </item>
<item>Provider documents each voucher case in a standardised patient 
treatment documentation form. </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>At the end of each month they hand in – respectively the claims processing 
agency (CPA) collects –  
<itemize>
<item>The voucher for each patient  
Copyright</item>
<item>The standardised patient treatment documentation form for each 
patient and</item>
<item>A summary claims form containing a summary of all treated voucher cases to 
the VMU for reimbursement.</item>
<item>The data from the forms is entered into a computer database. Data checks and
 plausibilisations are done.</item>
<item>Clean claims will be reimbursed via bank transfer.   </item>
<item>Conspicuous claims will be investigated and cleared by the VMU. </item>
<item>The VMU operates a monitoring system including follow-up with patients 
to monitor proper operation of the voucher scheme. </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.3.2">
<title> About Voucher Management system</title>
<text_body>The voucher management system VMS is designed to atomize 
the process of Voucher Management Unit (VMU) to minimize the manual process 
to maximize the quality of the project to understand the 
progress and timely out come of the project to take necessary steps by the MSIU 
Admin team to plan for the future and to increase the quality of the STD voucher 
service. The system will also control the existence of fraud in claims and will help
 the service provider to reach their payments in time without delay. 
The other features and details of system will be explained in below sections in the 
document.   The voucher management system is subdivided into following modules to 
make the system easy for understanding, developing, testing and to implement.    
<itemize>
<item>Voucher Creation / Preparation </item>
<item>Marketing / Sales </item>
<item>Claim Entry / Processing </item>
<item>Voucher Sales Return </item>
<item>Client Feed back </item>
<item>Reports (Standard and Customized) </item>
<item>Security and User Privileges </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>Each of the above modules are again subdivided into subsystems, those details are explained in 
below sections in the document </text_body>

<title>Overall Description</title>
<p id="2.1">
<title>System Perspective </title>
<text_body>This section of the document is going to explain the functionalities of 
the system, its subsystems and how it’s integrated and working together. 
During the system study, it was understood that the first pilot period, twenty 
thousand vouchers will be sold, but the VMU-system has the provision to upgrade to meet 
the additional market and projects needs. </text_body>
<p id="2.1.1">
<title> Outline of entire system </title>
<text_body>
<itemize>
<item>The VMU will create the vouchers and sell it to clients through distributors</item>
<item>The distributor will submit the sales details back to the VMU. </item>
<item>Each voucher should have two portions with three tear off voucher slips each 
for Client and Partner.</item>
<item>The client and/or the partner will choose the service provider and will get treatment</item>
<item>First visit is called as Consultation and if the patient is not cured then they can go 
for first follow 
up and second follow up,  </item>
<item>If the patient is not cured then the doctor will refer the patient to some other 
Hospitals the hospital may be 
another VSP or any other.  </item>
<item>Each visit details (including Diagnosis, Lab Test and Drugs) of the patient is 
called a claim, </item>
<item>The VSP will submit the claim to VMIU field office to enter those into the database, </item>
<item>The filed office will validate the claim form manually and through system,  </item>
<item>If any of mandatory information is missed or any false information is existing 
then the field office will reject the claim back to VSP and 
the system will keep those claim in a quarantine area</item>
<item>The quarantined forms will be sent back to the VSP for verification, if the VSP 
returns the claim with satisfactory details, the claims will be entered on to the system, 
in the following month’s batch. </item>
<item>Based on the payment terms agreed by VSP, the field office will generate 
BiMonth or Monthly financial and medical report and send it to MSIU Admin team to arrange 
the payments for the VSP. </item>
<item>To understand the satisfaction of client the MSIU Admin team will get client feedback 
from some of the clients and send those documents 
to field office to enter those into database. </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>As mentioned above the entire system is sub-divided into six modules 
and again the each module 
is subdivided into different subsystems. </text_body>
</p>
<p id="2.1.2">
<title>2.1.2 Voucher Management System Modules </title>
<p id="1.">
<title> Voucher Creation / Preparation</title>
<text_body>Voucher creation – the voucher numbers are system generated 
and created with unique identification numbers with security protocols in-built. 
The created unique numbers are then printed out in the form of bar-codes, which will 
complement (or stuck on the voucher) the voucher. Then at every level on the voucher 
cycle this number is captured, on distribution, retail sales, point of treatment, enclosed 
along with claim forms, at the claims processing and finally for the payment. 
Such tracking records will be utilized for reports as well. Each voucher should have the 
following properties, which will have sub-elements to get the batch numbers, voucher 
numbers, and the project codes. Project code – Group batch code – Batch number – 
Voucher number – Security code.  
<itemize>
<item>Project Code (2 Digit) Example: P001 </item>
<item>Group Batch (3 Digit) each group batch has a batch of 100 Batches Example: GP0001 </item>
<item>Batch number (2 Digit) approximately each batch will have 10 vouchers </item>
<item>Voucher number (10 digit)</item>
<item>Security Code </item>
<item>All codes will be printed out in the form of Bar </item>
<item>Additionally the provision for validity date check for the period of vouchers to be
used in the program is provided. This validity date can be amended or altered at the 
system level ONLY by the authorized user</item>
<item>Voucher will also have MRP (maximum retail price) </item>
<item>Voucher should have three tear off portioned slips with a sub-section tear-off for 
the partner. </item>
<item>If the tear off voucher slips would be sticker then it will not be lost on attaching to 
the claim 
forms by the VSP.</item>
<item>Each voucher slip should contain the bar code of the Voucher with two 
identifications one for the client and 
the other for the partner. </item>
<item>The first tear for the first consultation </item>
<item>Second one for the first follow-up </item>
<item>And the third tear off for the final (second follow-up). </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<p id="Design Constraints">
<text_body>This system has high security feature as far as the user access to the 
system, including all the modules, 
sub-modules and even at the screen level. 
<itemize>
<item>The voucher will be created ONLY by the authorized person.</item> 
<item>The will be a provision to create a minimum quantity of vouchers at one time 
(such minimum numbers will 
be decided by the management team). </item> 
<item>Once created vouchers will not be edited or deleted but there will be a provision 
to with-hold any voucher number if the admin 
team decides to do for any reason. </item> 
<item>There will be a provision to amend the validity date of the voucher. </item> 
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="2.">
<title> Marketing / Sales </title>
<text_body>The marketing and sales is the next step and the next module in the system. 
This module will take care of following sub modules. </text_body>
<p id="i">
<title>Distributor Master Information </title>
<text_body>The system will capture the master details of every distributor so that 
the users can get the details of any distributor and sales details at any time. Each 
distributor will have unique code and detailed descriptions such as name, address, 
locations and type of business etc. such valid information will help us track 
information related to sales and distributions. 
Following fields will be captured at this master. 
<itemize>
<item>Distributor Code (3 Digit) Example: DS0001* </item>
<item>Name of the distributor* </item>
<item>Type of business (e.g. hospital/pharmacy/NGO)* </item>
<item>Proprietor Name* </item>
<item>Designation </item>
<item>Address (Street/Road, Sub District, County, Sub County and Village or Town)* </item>
<item>Contact No </item>
<item>Email Id </item>
<item>Status (active/deactivate) </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>All fields with * are mandatory!</text_body>
<p id="Design Constraints">
<text_body>The address field will capture the geographical location of the distributor, 
such as District, Sub-District, County, Sub-County or Village / Town, road or street. All 
the level of details will have a master table in order to update as per the program 
requirements.  
The system will check the duplicated ID for the distributors. The system can allow 
the duplicate names of the Distributor. On capture of any duplicate name the system 
will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change the name. 
For better reporting purposes it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name.  
System will have a provision to print the distributor master details.  
The distributor screen will have a provision to view the Sales History of a 
particular distributor with following summary details.  
Distributor Name as Report Header and following as the report footer 
<itemize>
<item>Batch No </item>
<item>Date of purchase </item>
<item>Qty Purchase </item>
<item>Qty Sold </item>
<item>Qty Returned </item>
<item>Balance Qty (any other details required by the MSIU office) </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>There will be a provision to select a particular distributor to view the details 
(e.g. sales) by double clicking on the grid.  
Print option of above report is based on User Login Permission only.  
There will be an option for doing the following at every screen.
<itemize>
<item>
New
(adding new records) 
</item>
<item>
Edit
(updating available records) 
</item>
<item>
Delete
(deleting will be allowed only if no child records are created) 
</item>
<item>
Active/Deactivate
 (if the distributor has to be deactivated or terminated) 
</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>There will also be a provision for the other users to view the details of a
 distributor with purchase and sales details.</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="ii">
<text_body>The system will capture the details of MSIU Salesman; this would help 
the MSIU management team to understand the performance of each Team or salesman. 
During every distribution transaction the user should select the name of the sales man 
listed from Team Master. 
The Salesman master should capture following information’s. 
<itemize>
<item>Salesman Code* </item>
<item>Name of the Salesman* </item>
<item>DOB &amp; Age* </item>
<item>Gender* </item>
<item>Communication Address* </item>
<item>Contact No </item>
<item>E-Mail Id </item>
<item>Sales-team (which will have a separate master)*. </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The sales team master is for the future development of this program, 
if this program is extended to a country-wide network, 
this master will help understand and tack sales information. </text_body>
<p id="Design Constraints">
<text_body>The system will check the duplicated ID for the salesman and team. 
The system can allow the duplicate names of the salesman. On capture of any duplicate 
name the system will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change 
the name. For better reporting purposes 
it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="iii">
<title>Distribution Transactions (Sales from MSIU to Distributor) </title>
<text_body>The system will capture the details of voucher sales between MISU 
sales team and Distributors. During the distribution the system will capture the 
following details, to make Distribution process easily. With the below details the 
user can get the details of Distributor-wise and Salesman-wise 
and Batch No wise sales details as reports. 
<itemize>
<item>Name of the distributor* </item>
<item>Name of the Sales Man* </item>
<item>Date of distribution* </item>
<item>No of vouchers sold* </item>
<item>According to the number of vouchers required by the distributor, 
the system should allocate the relevant vouchers with their 
numbers and batch numbers based on the stock. </item>
<item>Invoice amount = No of vouchers x Wholesale price </item>
<item>Mode of payment is Cash </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<p id="Design Constraints">
<text_body>The mandatory information required during a distribution transaction is 
mentioned below.
<itemize>
<item>Name of the distributor (Selecting from Distributor Master) </item>
<item>Name of the Sales Man (Selecting from Sales man master) </item>
<item>Date of Distribution (Date selection option) </item>
<item>Required Qty (No of vouchers sold (Allow only Numeric Entry)) </item>
<item>Invoice Amount = Whole Sale Rate (should taken from settings master based on sale date)  
* Qty Sold. (Automatic Calculation) </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The system will generate an auto-generated number as Distribution 
Invoice No.  
Suppose the distributor or salesman name is not available in the system, then the 
system has a provision to navigate quickly to its master screen and enter the new 
Distributor and Salesman details, 
without closing the present screen.  
While entering the No of vouchers required, the system should automatically 
pick the Batch No’s with voucher No’s from the available voucher stock and list the 
details of each voucher with below information’s as a grid format. 
<itemize>
<item>Batch No </item>
<item>Voucher No </item>
<item>Validity Date </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The date of distribution will be current (system) date. But the date of sale 
can be the past dates. 
There will be a future date sale validation check available. </text_body>
</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p id="3.">
<title>Claim Entry/Processing</title>
<text_body>The program will take maximum care in this form and table, as it 
become a vital transaction to be captured. In this module you will see that every 
capture of data will be 
validated and checked on saving into the database. For e.g. the capture of voucher 
number, clinical information, diagnosis details, drug and investigation details and 
the costs are going to provide the program a vital report information. The system 
development team will focus its attention in making this module/table function 
efficiently.  For the easy understanding and designing of the system, this module is 
subdivided into following sub-modules. The division of sub-module is purely based 
on the sub-level categories of the data information. 
<itemize>
<item>The service (treatment) will happen at the VSP (Service Provider) clinic or hospital </item>
<item>The attending doctor will fill the claims form. </item>
<item>On completion of the service the patient will provide the voucher according 
to the visit type and patient type (client or partner), 
the voucher will be stuck to the claim form. </item>
<item>The thumb print will also be placed on completion of the service</item>
<item>The VSP will send the collected claim forms monthly and send it to MSIU field office. </item>
<item>MSIU office will then process the claim.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<p id="i">
<title>Voucher Service Provider (VSP) Master Information </title>
<text_body>The VSP master will have the following information: 
<itemize>
<item>VSP Code </item>
<item>Providers Name </item>
<item>Physical Address (Street / Road, District, Sub-District, County, SubCounty, Village/Town) </item>
<item>Communication Address (Street / Road, District, Sub-District, County, Sub-County, Village/Town) </item>
<item>Health Sub-District </item>
<item>Locality </item>
<item>Level Of Facility </item>
<item>Type of facility </item>
<item>Registration Body </item>
<item>Contact Person </item>
<item>Designation </item>
<item>Contact No </item>
<item>E-Mail id </item>
<item>Status (Active / In-Active) </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<p id="Design Constraints">
<text_body>Other than Contact No and E-Mail Id all other information are mandatory 
during the creation of a new Service Provider.  
The VSP code is a digit code with suffix SP, would be automatically generated by the 
system.  
The system should generate message with two option “Continue – Yes/No” while the 
user trying to create a new VSP with an existing name, If the user press Yes the 
system will allow the user to enter the same, if not the system wont allow the new 
entry to save.  
The system will list District, Sub-District, County, Sub-County, Village / Town 
from the master during VSP creation, if any of them are not available in the system, 
then the system will have the provision to navigate quickly to its master screen and 
do enter master details and back to VSP screen.   
The values of Health Sub – District, Locality, Level Of Facility, Type of facility, 
Registration Body would be list from their own master and should select the details 
based on the VSP. If any of the information is not available in existing master of 
above, then the system will have the provision to navigate quickly to its form to 
enter the master details and back to VSP Screen. The system will populate Active VSP 
only on other screen during data entry process, 
but the system will also populate all VSP for report purpose.  
Activation and In-activation of VSP is purely based on the MSIU Management decision. 
But if the system is found more than two fraud entries during the claim process of 
particular VSP, then the system would automatically change the status of that particular 
VSP as In-activate. Activation of that particular VSP is again purely based on MSIU 
Management decision.  
The VSP Master Information screen should have a provision to enter the payment terms 
agreed between MSIU and VSP. The system will capture following master details to fill 
the payment terms. 
<itemize>
<item>Payment Mode (Cash / Bank) </item>
<item>Bank Account No </item>
<item>Bank Name </item>
<item>Payment Type (Selection from list of options Bi-Monthly/Monthly) </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The below details may periodically change depends on the MSIU management decision. 
<itemize>
<item>Valid From (Date selection option) </item>
<item>Valid up to (Date selection option) </item>
<item>First Visit Consultation Fee (Only Numeric Entry, default 0) </item>
<item>First follow up visit Consultation Fee (Only Numeric Entry, default 0) </item>
<item>First second up visit Consultation Fee (Only Numeric Entry, default 0) </item>
<item>First visit Lab Fee (Only Numeric Entry, default 0) </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>The above mentioned payment terms will help the MSIU to make the 
payment detail easy and also help the VSP to get their payment in timeThe system will 
control the payment process and terms.  The allowed users only can able to Add, Modify 
or delete the VSP master information including payment terms.  
The VSP screen will have the provision to view the Claim Status of selected VSP. The 
system will facilitate to show the user following details if necessary.  
VSP Name (as the report header and below as the details part of report) 
<itemize>
<item>Claim No </item>
<item>Date </item>
<item>Date of System Entry </item>
<item>Amount </item>
<item>Status</item>
<item>Remarks </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>Cumulative Total Amount will show in Report footer for the previous payment done. </text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="ii">
<title>VSP Staff Master Information </title>
<text_body>The system will have the facility to capture the details of VSP staff 
details and the necessary master information 
while entering the claim into the system.
<itemize>
<item>VSP Name </item>
<item>Staff Code </item>
<item>Staff Name </item>
<item>Staff Type </item>
<item>Qualification </item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<p  id="Design Contraints">
<text_body>The system will generate message while creating a new staff with 
existing name, but the system will allow 
the user to save that new staff if its required. 
All above information’s other than Qualification are mandatory during 
the creation of new staff under any VSP.  
The system will automatically create Staff Code with Suffix as VSP Code

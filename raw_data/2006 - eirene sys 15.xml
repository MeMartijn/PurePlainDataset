<title>Introduction</title>


<p id="1.1">
<title>General</title>

<p id="1.1.1">
<text_body>This specification has been developed within UIC Project EIRENE. It specifies a digital
radio standard for the European railways. It forms part of the specification for
technical interoperability. (I)
</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.2">
<title>Scope</title>
<p id="1.2.1">
<text_body>The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines a radio system satisfying the
mobile communications requirements of the European railways [EIRENE FRS]. It
encompasses ground-train voice and data communications, together with the groundbased
mobile communications needs of trackside workers, station and depot staff and
railway administrative and managerial personnel. (I)
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.2.2">
<text_body>Figure 1-1 shows how the EIRENE system is covered in this specification, by
associating each element of the system with its corresponding section number(s).
References specifying the main interfaces are also cited, and are detailed more
extensively in Appendix A. (I)</text_body>
<p id="Figure 1-1">
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.2.3">
<text_body>The application of this specification will ensure interoperability for trains and staff
crossing national or other borders between systems. It also intends to provide
manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical. (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.3">
<title>Appliccability</title>
<p id="1.3.1">
<text_body>The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines the set of requirements which
a railway radio system shall comply with in order to ensure interoperability between
national railways. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.3.2">
<text_body>The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification [EIRENE FRS] specifies the
functional requirements for EIRENE. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.3.3">
<text_body>The specification distinguishes between requirements affecting a railway’s network
infrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerning
mobiles which may be used in any EIRENE compliant network. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.3.4">
<text_body>The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: (I)
<itemize>
<item>Mandatory (indicated by ‘(M)’ at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory that
each railway meets these specifications where interoperability on lines, or
equipment interoperability, is required.</item>
<item>Optional (indicated by ‘(O)’ at the end of the paragraph). Whilst not being
mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in
the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory,
both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreed
standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development
and manufacture.</item>
<item>Information (indicated by ‘(I)’ at the end of the paragraph). These are statements
intended to provide explanatory notes.</item>
</itemize>

<title>System Overview</title>
<p id="1.4.1">
<title>Extent of specification</title>
<p id="1.4.1.1">
<text_body>The system is based on the ETSI GSM standard. To meet additional functionality and
performance requirements, this standard is to be supplemented by: (I)
<itemize>
<item>the following GSM services:</item>
<item>voice broadcast service;</item>
<item>voice group call service;</item>
<item>enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption;</item>
<item>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS);</item>
<item>railway specific applications:</item>
<item>exchange of number and location information between train and ground to support
functional and location dependent addressing;</item>
<item>emergency calls;</item>
<item>shunting mode;</item>
<item>multiple driver communications;</item>
<item>direct mode facility for set-to-set operation;</item>
<item>railway specific features, network parameters and standards:</item>
<item>link assurance signal;</item>
<item>calling and connected line presentation of functional identities;</item>
<item>cab radio, man-machine and other interfaces;</item>
<item>environmental specifications;</item>
<item>controller position functional specifications;</item>
<item>system configuration (numbering plans, priority levels, subscriber details, closed
user groups, etc).</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.1.2">
<text_body>The scope of the specification is shown in figure 1-2, showing the hierarchy of the
GSM, and railway features to be implemented. (I)</text_body>
<p id="Figure 1-2">
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.4.1.3">
<text_body>A list of ETSI and 3GPP specifications is provided in the normative references
section of this document. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.1.4">
<text_body>Compliance to the list of normative documents is mandatory for all of the GSM
services necessary to provide the functionality specified in the [EIRENE FRS]. (M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.1.5">
<text_body>Later releases of these specifications may be used, providing that the system is
backwards-compatible with the versions listed. (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2">
<title>Outline Architecture</title>
<p id="1.4.2.1">
<text_body>The system is based on the GSM architecture which is summarised in figure 1-3. (I)</text_body>
<p id="Figure 1-3">
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.2">
<text_body>The system comprises the following elements: (I)
<itemize>
<item>Base station sub-systems (BSSs) of base station controllers (BSCs) controlling base
transceiver stations (BTSs) each containing a number of transceivers (TRXs).</item>
<item>Network sub-systems (NSSs) interfacing to the BSS via the GSM ‘A’ interface. The
NSS contains mobile services switching centres (MSCs) with primary responsibility
for call control. The MSC is supported by a visitor location register (VLR)
containing temporary details of subscribers active within the MSC area, a group
call register (GCR) containing attributes of voice group and broadcast call
configurations for the related MSC area and home location registers (HLRs)
holding subscriber details on a permanent basis.</item>
<item>The network also comprises General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) infrastructure
elements supporting the respective packet radio services. The serving GPRS
support node (SGSN) is a location register function storing subscription
information and location information for each subscriber registered in that node. It
interfaces to the BSS via the Gb interface and to the MSC/VLR via the Gs interface
and to the HLR via the Gr interface. The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a
location register function storing subscription information and routeing
information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the
SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN has at
least one PDP context active. It interfaces to the SGSN via the Gn interface, to the
HLR via the Gx interface, to external packet data networks via the Gi interface and
to other GSM/GPRS networks via the Gp interface.</item>
<item>Mobile equipment (ME) interfacing to the BSS via the air (Um) interface.</item>
<item>Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) containing information specific to single
subscribers. A standardised interface links mobile equipment to SIM cards. A SIM
and ME combined are termed a mobile station (MS).</item>
<item>Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC) for managing the network.</item>
<item>Billing Centre.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.3">
<text_body>Signalling within the NSS and between NSSs is carried out according to signalling
system number 7, SS7, making specific use of the mobile application part (MAP) of that
standard. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.4">
<text_body>Railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to
the GSM network in order to support railway specific messaging applications. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.5">
<text_body>A railway GSM network is also likely to have external interfaces to: (I)
<itemize>
<item>private railway fixed networks;</item>
<item>public operator networks;</item>
<item>controller equipment;</item>
<item>specialised railway systems (eg train control systems).</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.6">
<text_body>EIRENE will provide the radio bearer for ERTMS/ETCS. The EURORADIO layers are
responsible for ensuring the overall safety of the transmission link between train-borne
and trackside ERTMS/ETCS applications. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.7">
<text_body>In addition to a GSM capability, a direct mode capability may be provided for railway
mobiles for set-to-set operation. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.8">
<text_body>Standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to
EIRENE to access EIRENE bearer services. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.2.9">
<text_body>Applications may include: (I)
<itemize>
<item>public address;</item>
<item>intercom;</item>
<item>driver safety device;</item>
<item>train borne recorder.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3">
<title>Railway specif services and facilities</title>
<p id="1.4.3.1">
<text_body>To meet the specific railway requirements, a number of additional features are
required some of which have been incorporated in the GSM Standard. The main
aspects are summarised in the following paragraphs. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.2">
<title>Frequency:</title>
<text_body>Equipment is to be capable of operation in the following frequency bands:
(I)
<itemize>
<item>Band Railway GSM (R-GSM)</item>
<item>Frequencies (MHz) 876-915/921-960</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
<text_body>Note: the R-GSM band includes the Public GSM (P-GSM) and Extended GSM (E-GSM)
bands.</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.3">
<title>Voice broadcast and group call facilities:</title>
<text_body>All mobiles are to support these services as
defined in the relevant GSM specifications. The services will mainly be used to: (I)
<itemize>
<item>broadcast messages from controllers to certain groups of trains in a controller area;</item>
<item>broadcast messages from trains or shunting team members to controllers or other
mobiles in a defined area;</item>
<item>conduct group calls between train drivers and controllers over pre-defined areas;</item>
<item>conduct group calls between trackside workers, shunting team members, station
staff and similar groups, typically over local areas.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.4">
<title>Enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption:</title>
<text_body>This GSM specification is to be
implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for
emergency group calls. It is also necessary to meet different grades of service
requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system (eg safety (eg
train control system), operational and administrative communications). (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.5">
<title>Functional numbering:</title>
<text_body>Many railway staff need to be addressed by functional rather
than personal numbers. The functional numbers may change on a regular basis. The
principal example is that of train drivers, who need to be addressed by train numbers
which change with each journey. To overcome this difficulty a translation facility will
be provided to allow calls to functional numbers to be forwarded to the most
appropriate personal number at that time. Thus calls made to a train number are
forwarded by the network to the appropriate driver or locomotive for that train at that
time. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.6">
<text_body>A follow-me service will be implemented in the EIRENE network using the GSM
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) facility to allow users to establish
and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal
number. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.7">
<title>Location dependent addressing:</title>
<text_body>Train drivers need to be able to contact controllers
and other staff at the push of a single button. As the train moves through different
areas, controllers are liable to change. As a consequence it is necessary to provide a
means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the
train. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.8">
<text_body>The only source of location information available within the GSM network is the cell
that the train is in. However, there are a number of external sources from which more
accurate location information may be derived: (I)
<itemize>
<item>on-train location systems;</item>
<item>trackside balises;</item>
<item>information from ground based systems.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.9">
<text_body>Within EIRENE, the primary means of determining the location of a train for the
purpose of location dependent addressing will be based on the cell dependent routing.
This may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to
provide a greater degree of accuracy. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="1.4.3.10">
<title>Direct mode:</title>
<text_body>Railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a
mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use
of GSM infrastructure. Such a mode is required for use where: (I)
<itemize>
<item>no GSM infrastructure is provided;</item>
<item>GSM infrastructure equipment has failed.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p id="1.5">

<title>Alerting duration</title>
<p id="2.6.1">
<text_body>The call waiting service (CW) permits a party A to be notified of an incoming call from
party C whilst the traffic channel is not available for the incoming call and party A is
engaged in an active call with party B. However call waiting does not operate during
the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used).
Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the
risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a
higher eMLPP priority. Taking into account technical and operational aspects, it is
recommended to set the relevant timer(s) in the network in such a way that the
maximum alerting duration is limited to 60s. (I)</text_body>

<title>Network configuration</title>
<p id="3.1">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="3.1.1">
<text_body>EIRENE mobiles are specified to conform to a common minimum standard of
performance. It is the responsibility of national railways to design their EIRENE
networks to provide the required level of service to EIRENE compliant mobiles. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.1.2">
<text_body>This section draws together specifications and information related to the planning of
an EIRENE network and provides guidance on target performance levels. Additional
information on communication requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS application is
provided in [ERTMS COMMS]. (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="3.2">
<title>Coverage</title>
<p id="3.2.1">
<text_body>For network planning, the coverage level is defined as the field strength at the antenna
on the roof of a train (nominally a height of 4m above the track). An isotropic antenna
with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. This criterion will be met with a certain probability in
the coverage area. (The target coverage power level is dependent on the statistical
fluctuations caused by the actual propagation conditions.) (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.2.2">
<text_body>The following minimum values shall apply: (M)
<itemize>
<item>coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 38.5 dBmV/m (-98 dBm)
for voice and non-safety critical data;</item>
<item>coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 41.5 dBmV/m (-95 dBm)
on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds lower than or equal to 220km/h.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.2.3">
<text_body>The following minimum values are recommended: (I)
<itemize>
<item>coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level of 44.5 dBmV/m (-92 dBm)
on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds above 280km/h;</item>
<item>coverage probability of 95% based on a coverage level between 41.5 dBmV/m and
44.5 dBmV/m (-95 dBm and –92 dBm) on lines with ETCS levels 2/3 for speeds
above 220km/h and lower than or equal to 280km/h.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.2.4">
<text_body>The EIRENE mobile installation shall be designed to operate in a network meeting the
criteria in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. (M)
<itemize>
<item>Note 1: The specified coverage probability means that with a probability value of at
least 95% in each location interval (length: 100m) the measured coverage level
shall be greater than or equal to the figures stated above. The coverage levels
specified above consider a maximum loss of 3 dB between antenna and
receiver and an additional margin of 3 dB for other factors such as ageing. (I).</item>
<item>The values for ETCS levels 2/3 concerning coverage and speed-limitations are
to be validated and, if necessary, reviewed after the first operational
implementation of ETCS. (I)</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="3.3">
<title>Handover and cell selection</title>
<p id="3.3.1">
<text_body>The handover success rate should be at least 99.5% over train routes under design load
conditions (as given in [EN 301 515, Index [30]]). (O)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.3.2">
<text_body>To avoid the necessity for large cell overlaps to accommodate high speed train
operations, optimisation of the handover process for such trains is considered
necessary. Suitable algorithms will be tested and refined as necessary during the trials
process. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.3.3">
<text_body>The proposed events for measurement of the start and stop of the handover execution
at the mobile are: (I)
<itemize>
<item>receipt of ‘handover command’;</item>
<item>receipt of ‘UA’ after ‘physical info’ on new channel.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.3.4">
<text_body>There is a quality of service requirement for handover executions (eg a break of 10s
would clearly be unacceptable to the user). 300ms represents our current best estimate
of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.3.5">
<text_body>An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use
of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms.
Synchronous handover requires the BTS transmissions in different cells to be
synchronised by the system. Each authority can decide whether it wishes to use
synchronised BTSs. (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="3.4">
<title>Call setup time requirement</title>
<p id="3.4.1">
<text_body>Call setup time requirement is dependent upon the eMLPP priority of a call [EN 301 515,
Index [27]]. The required priority level for each call type is given in section 10.2. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.4.2">
<text_body>Call setup times as defined in the EIRENE FRS shall be achieved with authentication
and ciphering procedures enabled. (M)
<itemize>
<item>Note: Authentication may be delayed if necessary to achieve the required call setup
times.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.4.3">
<text_body>In order to achieve these times the passage of the call through any networks external to
GSM (eg from the GSM MSC to a controller linked by an ISDN connection) must take
less than 250ms. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.4.4">
<text_body>Achievement of fast call setup times requires information in the setup message to be
compressed. A maximum of 12 digits may be sent as mobile originator-to-dispatcher
information. (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="3.5">
<title>Frequency band and channel arrangements</title>
<p id="3.5.1">
<text_body>The network shall operate in a sub-band, or combination of sub-bands, of the R-GSM
band as defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. (M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.5.2">
<text_body>The UIC frequency band for GSM-R is defined in [CEPT 25-09], [1999/569/EC] and
[ECC(02)05]: (I)
<itemize>
<item>876 – 880 MHz (mobile station transmit); paired with</item>
<item>921 – 925 MHz (base station transmit).</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.5.3">
<text_body>The carrier frequency is designated by the absolute radio frequency channel number
(ARFCN), and is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [35]]. For carriers in the UIC frequency
band the following convention shall be used, where Fl(n) is the frequency value of the
carrier ARFCN n in the lower band, and Fu(n) the corresponding frequency value in
the upper band: (M)
<itemize>
<item>Fl(n) = 890 + 0.2*(n-1024) 955 £ n £ 973</item>
<item>Fu(n) = Fl(n) + 45</item>

<p id="9.1.3">
<text_body>The precise details of the numbering plan to be chosen for particular railways will
depend upon the railway network configuration, its interconnection with other

Equipment design must therefore be such as to give maximum flexibility in numbering
arrangements. However, it may be generally assumed that numbers (excluding access
prefixes) will not exceed 15 digits in length and will consist entirely of the digits 1 to 9
and 0. (I)</text_body>

<title>Numbering plan limitations</title>
<p id="9.3.1">
<text_body>The EIRENE network can not be considered as a fully private network, as some parts
of either the mobile or fixed networks may be provided by public operators. This leads
to certain restrictions on the implementation of a numbering plan. These restrictions
are given below. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="Number allocation">
<p id="9.3.2">
<text_body>To achieve integration of the EIRENE numbering plan with the national public
numbering plan, telephone numbers have to be allocated by the various numbering
regulatory bodies on a national basis. If functional numbers are to be used outside the
EIRENE network, they will require either a public number allocation or, alternatively,
an EIRENE Network Access Number (ENAN) may be used as described in 9.11 (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="9.3.3">
<text_body>Each national railway should obtain a public numbering allocation for MSISDN
numbers from the relevant regulatory bodies. (O)</text_body>

<text_body>The EIRENE numbering plan shall be standardised to allow interoperability and shall
be implemented as a private numbering plan within the GSM-R network. (M)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="Use of alphanumerical numbers">
<p id="9.3.5">
<text_body>In some countries Train Numbers are alphanumeric. These numbers do not comply
with a numbering plan that can be interpreted by telephone switches and are therefore
not supported by the call routing solution given in section 11. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="9.3.6">
<text_body>If alphanumerical numbering is required within a railway network, then these
numbers may either be translated at the user terminal into a subscriber number or
conveyed between the calling party and a routing database using a nationally
determined approach. (I)</text_body>

<p id="Figure 9-1">
</p>
<text_body>
<itemize>
<item>
1) Call Type:
The Call Type (CT) prefix is used to distinguish between the different types of
User Numbers that are allowed within the national EIRENE numbering plan. It is
an indication to the network of how to interpret the number dialled. (I)
</item>
<item>
2) User Identifier Number: The User Identifier Number (UIN) shall be one of the following numbers (as
identified by the CT): (M)
<itemize>
<item>
Train Number (TN):
a number given to a train by operational staff for a
particular journey. This number shall be unique for the duration of the journey.
</item>
<item>
Note.
For certain Train Numbers (e.g. 1234 and 123), a risk exists when dialling
a number by keying in individual digits e.g. by the dispatcher. In this
circumstance the risk of connecting to an un-intended train exists if there is a
delay between keyed-in digits. There is no risk of ambiguity if block dialling is
employed.
</item>
<item>
Engine Number (EN):
a unique number given to a tractive unit to identify it
permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking system
for tractive stock crossing frontiers [UIC 438-3]. In order to call a particular
locomotive, it shall be possible to call a number associated with the tractive
unit's stock number. The actual number of the unit, which shall be used as the
EN, is based on the complete identification number.
</item>
<item>
Coach Number (CN):
a unique number given to a coach (which is not a tractive
unit) to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform
identification marking for passenger rolling stock [UIC 438-1]. In order to call a
particular coach it shall be possible to call a number associated with the vehicle
marking. The total vehicle marking consists of 12 digits. The actual number of
the coach is denoted by seven digits (positions 5 to 11 of the complete vehicle
marking), which shall be used as the CN7.

<p id="10.1.1">
<text_body>In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, in
particular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between
networks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information
stored in the network. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="10.1.2">
<text_body>For the purposes of defining common subscription profiles, a number of subscription
types might be used, for example: (I)

<title>Access classes</title>
<p id="10.3.1">
<text_body>User access classes are defined in GSM so that under critical conditions, part of the
user population can be barred from accessing the network in order to avoid
congestion. However, such barring can be overridden by a user being a member of one
or more of the following special access classes: (I)
<itemize>
<item>11 open to network operator;</item>
<item>12 security services;</item>

<title>Functional numbering and location dependent addressing</title>
<p id="11.1">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="11.1.1">
<text_body>There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a ‘functional number’
rather than a more permanent subscriber number. Such numbers are generally only
associated with a user for a limited period of time. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="11.1.2">
<text_body>This is an important issue which will affect interoperability and the ability to use
public network services. There are specific features of individual railways which make
it difficult to develop a concise and universally acceptable system within GSM. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="11.1.3">
<text_body>To accommodate the different requirements of the individual railways, the following
approach has been adopted: (I)
<itemize>
<item>all responsibility for handling addressing lies with the network infrastructure and
other ground based equipment, rather than additional functionality in the mobile;</item>
<item>each railway will be responsible for implementing addressing schemes which best
meet its needs;</item>
<item>national addressing schemes are to use the internationally standardised groundtrain
protocol, based on a single standardised GSM service, for exchanging
information between the ground and mobiles.</item>

<p id="11.2.2">
<text_body>The first is related to passing information to provide an association between a mobile’s

<text_body>A Railway emergency call is a high priority call for informing drivers, controllers and
other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railway movements in a
pre-defined area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined: (I)

<text_body>This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for Railway operational
emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of ‘112’ calls). (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="13.2">
<title>Provision of Railway emergency calls</title>
<p id="13.2.1">
<text_body>Railway emergency calls are defined as those calls of ‘Railway emergency’ priority (see
section 10) which are routed to a pre-defined user or group of users due to a railway
operational emergency. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.2.2">
<text_body>All Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using GSM VGCS (Specifications
[EN 301 515, Index [21] &amp; [4]]). (M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.2.3">
<text_body>It shall be possible to configure Railway emergency group call areas to contain
combinations of cells controlled by one or more MSC(s) within one or more network(s).
(M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.2.4">
<text_body>Where Railway emergency group call areas are controlled by more than one MSC
within one or more network(s), a unique anchor MSC is defined for each group call
area. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.2.5">
<text_body>For international Railway emergency calls, in order to minimise call set-up times, it is
recommended that the anchor MSC always directly controls the cell where the Railway
emergency call was originated. (I)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="13.3">
<title>Initiation of Railway emergency calls</title>
<p id="13.3.1">
<text_body>A Railway emergency call shall be initiated by using the appropriate function code for
the required type of Railway emergency call (see Table 9-8). (M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.3.2">
<text_body>The call area and list of train controllers for each emergency group call will be fixed in
the Group Call Register (GCR) of the anchor MSC. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.3.3">
<text_body>The Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability are defined in section
9.5. The composition of each group is a matter for national implementation, although
all areas shall have a group defined for all mandated Group IDs. (M)</text_body>
</p>
</p>
<p id="13.4">
<title>Receipt of Railway emergency calls</title>
<p id="13.4.1">
<text_body>Each mobile shall store a list of emergency Group IDs in the SIM appropriate to its
function (the Cab radio will store Group ID 299 and 599 - see table 9-8). (M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.4.2">
<text_body>All Railway emergency group IDs required for interoperability and appropriate to the
operation of the mobile shall maintain active status whilst the mobile is powered up.
(M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.4.3">
<text_body>The fixed network user will only receive emergency voice calls if designated a
dispatcher or group member in any of the calls defined in the GSM GCR. (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.4.4">
<text_body>On receipt of a Railway emergency call, the controller’s display should indicate the
location of the train. (O)</text_body>

<p id="13.4.5">
<text_body>If the requirement in 13.4.4 is implemented, as a minimum the location information
shall be provided by the GSM network (eg current cell or base station serving the
mobile). (M)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.4.6">
<text_body>The mechanism for transferring the functional number of the originating mobile to
controllers is defined in [EN 301 515, Index [6], Release 4] using the Information Element
“Compressed OTDI” in the Immediate Setup 2 message from the originating mobile.
(I)</text_body>

Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information element to “1”.
Otherwise, the MSC Release bit in the “Control Channel Description” information
element shall be set to “0” (zero) [EN 301 515, Index [41]]. (M)</text_body>

<title>Confirmation of Railway emergency calls</title>
<p id="13.5.1">
<text_body>For post-incident analysis it is important that the initiation and receipt of Railway
emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based location
(and also registered in the train borne recorder, in cases where a train borne recorder is
connected to the Cab radio). (I)</text_body>
</p>
<p id="13.5.2">
<text_body>Not all calls require confirmation. The application must be able to deduce that a
confirmation is necessary from the call priority, as all calls of ‘Railway emergency’
priority must be confirmed. (M)</text_body>

<text_body>Confirmation of Railway emergency calls shall be implemented using the User to User
Signalling supplementary service (UUS1). (M)</text_body>

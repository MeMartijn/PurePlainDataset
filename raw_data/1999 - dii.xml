<title>IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONAL AREA</title>
<text_body>This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) establishes the functional, 
performance, and verification requirements for the XML Services (XS) functional area of 
the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE). 
The XS functional area includes Registration of terms (tags and structures), 
Design of XML schemas, Generation and Consumption of XML documents.
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="2.">
<title>FUNCTIONAL AREA OVERVIEW</title>
<text_body>XML Services provide infrastructure services for mission and 
support applications using XML technology. These services isolate vendor-unique 
implementations of data access and provide applications a means of avoiding 
dependencies on physical access models. These services also provide data 
management functions for access to distributed (local and remote) 
database management systems as one of the solutions for interoperablity.</text_body>
</p>
<p id="3.">
<title>DOCUMENT OVERVIEW</title>
<text_body>This document outlines the software capabilities required for the XS 
components for the DII COE. Section 2 lists the documents that are applicable to 
this specification. Section 3 provides a list of functional capabilities. Section 4 
identifies the qualification requirements. Section 5 outlines the requirements and 
verification traceability matrix. 
Section 6 contains the applicable notes associated with the XS component.

<title>REQUIRED STATES AND MODES</title>
<text_body>
<itemize>
<item>Environmental Mode: This is the real-time operations that must react to varying 
degrees of readiness to full scale wartime operations such as crisis planning with
 the use of heterogeneous data types and sources, transfer capabilities, data management
 services.</item>
<item>COE Compliance. XML Services shall be segmented. COE sponsors shall adhere 
to compliance level requirements described in the I&amp;RTS. </item>
<item>In the fixed (static) mode of operation (base or data processing megacenter), the
 data management services shall have the capability of being tuned by on-site personnel
 to adjust for varying workloads and sizes of associated databases. These workloads and
 databases are expected to change more frequently and to a greater extent than for 
processing associated with deployed units</item>
<item>In a changing (dynamic) environment, such as with deployed units, the workload
 and database sizes may be more predetermined (given a more precise mission) and 
require access to fewer data management administrative capabilities than needed in a 
fixed environment. The XS shall have the ability to redefine or reset names of connect 
descriptors to database server instances. Connect descriptors are fully qualified object 
names and include address (protocol/host/port) and instance name. </item>
<item>In a degraded communications environment, there is a need, for example, to 
be able to reset session time-out values if the data management services are being
 accessed by users affected by the communications degradation. At a minimum, the 
session time-out values shall be user definable and be able to be reset prior to 
initialization of a user session. The goal is to provide the option of dynamically changing
session time values based on current communications performance identified by 
capabilities of the network management or DBMS. </item>
<item>End User Mode: Portion of XS services shall be used by various classes of
 users: data consumers, data and database managers, network information infrastructure
 resource managers. Some of these uses of the data management services will entail 
unique requirements that shall be fulfilled within the capability of XS services.</item>
<item>Maintenance Mode: This mode includes modification and/or addition of 
application data segments, user permission, privileges, and restructuring storage
and memory areas. In addition, maintenance also shall pertain to shutdown, open 
not-mounted and online/off-line implementations, modifications, upgrade, or other 
related actions. The data management services shall support managing various types
 of data, database architectures and platforms that includes hardware and software at
 the specified sites. </item>
<item>Training Mode. In support of training activities, the data management services 
shall provide for the same processing as would be encountered in a production
 environment. However, access to the database may be via a training application 
access to the DBMS rather than from the production mission application.</item>
</itemize>
</text_body>
</p>
<p id="4.2">
<title>XML SERVICES CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS</title>
<text_body>The XS shall deliver inter-related components as shown
 in figure 3.2-1</text_body>

<title>GLOSSARY OF TERMS</title>
<text_body>
<itemize>
<item>Automatically:
 Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, 
but dependent on information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to 
these other processes. The information / parameters may be data dependent, or 
application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. 
It will include controls qualifying the processing involved.
</item>
<item>Business Rule:
A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within 
an organization. Business rules can be divided in to 
four categories: definitions, facts, constraints, and derivations.
</item>
<item>Definitions are business rules that define entities and attributes.</item>
<item>Facts are either links (relationships) between entities or associations 
between an entity and attributes</item>
<item>Constraints are conditions about the data that must always be true. 
They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database.</item>
<item>Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information. For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's 
age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date.</item>
<item>Commit/Rollback:
An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer 
of the data items involved.
</item>
<item>Discretionary Access Controls (DAC):
A means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable 
of passing that permission on to any other subject.
</item>
<item>Dynamically Generated Processing:
Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, 
but dependent upon information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied 
to these other processes. The information/parameters may be data dependent, 
or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will 
include controls qualifying the processing involved.
</item>
<item>Location Transparency:
occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the 
applications and users of the database system. For example, a view that joins 
table data from several databases provides location transparency because the 
user of the view 
does not need to know where the data originates from.
</item>
<item>Mandatory Access Control (MAC): 
Imediates access to an object based on the clearance level of the 
subject (user) and the sensitivity label of the object. (These controls are always 
enforced above any discretionary control implemented by users).
</item>
<item>Mirrored Databases:
Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis 
for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS 
RDBMS own system utilities and operating system.
</item>
<item>Object:
A passive entity that contains or receives information. 
Access to an object potentially implies access to the information it 
contains. Examples of objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, 
files, directories, directory trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, 
words, fields, processors, 
video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, and network nodes.
</item>
<item>Proponent Scheme:
Describes the sites at which databases are replicated and also 
who owns and has update authority with respect to the data at each site. It refers to 
proponency at the source and record level.
</item>
<item>Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID):
A RAID system appears as one very large, reliable disk to the CPU. 
The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability. RAID has the same 
advantages as 
shadowing and striping at a lower cost. There are several types/levels of RAID 
implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as 
disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across

check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array. If one 
disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate 
the lost data. Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level 
implementations to improve performance and reliability.

<item>Remote Data Access (RDA): 
is an ISO (9579) application layer interoperability standard 
(protocol and formats) to support access by an application to a (remote) 
DBMSs over an OSI network. The goal of RDA is to allow interoperability between 
applications (clients) and databases (servers) of different manufacturers so that 
an application is able to read and update data in remote databases via well defined 
standards. RDA defines a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL 
commands to these services. RDA also defines an interface to ISO (transaction processing) 
two phase commit TP services in the case where updates to multiple remote databases 
need to be coordinated. RDA does not yet define interoperability between server databases 
(i.e. it is not yet a standard for distributed database management).

</item>
<item>Replication Scheme:
Information that precisely identifies DBs, or partitions of DBs, to be 
copied and/or distributed, replication schedules, 
and master/remote sites that are to receive the copies.
</item>
<item>Spatial DBMS: 
Geographic information system that organizes and maintains spatial 
data (i.e. data with graphical attributes) in terms of type, scale, location(s), extent, 
topology and geometry. Supports queries of spatial 
data where the selection criteria are defined by spatial attributes.
</item>
<item>SRI:
A Standing Request For Information (SRI) is a capability in which CASS monitors for the occurrence of conditions established by an application program, and notifies the calling or establishing application program when the conditions are satisfied. An SRI may 
be one of three types: timer-based, data-based, or message-based.

<item>Subject: 
An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state. 
Technically, a process/domain pair.
</item>
<item>Transaction Journalling:
 Individual messages or database transactions are stored in a journal file, 
which may be a linear 
log file or a circular file.

<text_body>The metadata and procedures are described for the current Information Resource Submittal Package .

Metadata and Related Information
An XML tag may be described as any object and is easily 
created by anyone using a text editor. Although XML is a relatively new 
technology, many developers are already using XML in operational COE 
systems and have already created tags and specifications, many of which 
may be inconsistent with tags used in other systems. So far, the burgeoning 
sets of XML tags have 
created redundancy and irrelevancy, and they lack validity.
</item>
<item>
XML Registry. 
To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline 
set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community. 
The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your 
requirements. The Registry has a substring search capability so that the user may 
easily find information resources that meet the criteria. The user may specify whether 
to search for the term within 
the name of the information resource or the definition or both.
</item>
<item>
Developer's Role.
Developers are urged to review the baseline tags, adopt 
them where possible, and subscribe to future notifications about the tags. If, 
after reviewing the tags in the Registry, you cannot reuse an existing specification 
(a.k.a. Document Type Definition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your 
proposed tag to a Community of Interest (COI) and provide amplifying information 
for all to understand the semantics for its proper use. 
</item>
<item>
COE Chief Engineer's Role.
The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) 
for a COI to manage the tags within that COI. The COE Chief Engineer will reserve 
ultimate authority to mediate any 
unresolved disputes within all COIs. 
</item>
<item>
The COE Data Engineering Team's Role.
Tags and semantics will be analyzed to identify opportunities 
to consolidate tags towards a single or a minimal number of representations. 
A "market forces" model can also guide COE Data Engineering in identifying the weak 
candidates from the strong.8
</item>
<item>
The Community of Interest's POC's Role.
(The information in the following section is current as of 17 May, 1999. 
Please consult the Registry for the most authoritative list of information resources types.) 
The POC responsibilities will include the transitioning of information resources from one 
status to another. Table 1 lists the valid types of information resources. 
The status levels are developmental, 
candidate, approved, rejected, and retired.

<title>Use "XML_Attributes" sparingly</title>
<text_body>If the term is well recognized outside its container term, designate 
it as an element. Example: CTRY_CD, CTRY_NM, CTRY_ABBRD_NM, CTRY_OFF_NM, 
CTRY_SCP_NT_TX, and CTRY_PSTL_NM 
are all characteristics (ER-attributes) for the entity CTRY. In the relational world, 
they are columns within the table ctry, attributes of the entity ctry in er-modeling, 
and member attributes in object modeling. It would be expected that a submitter 
would identify them as attributes rather than elements. But if they were identified as 
attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be 
carried, or submitted as separate elements. We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, 
so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly. </text_body>

<p id="Include descriptive definitions AND synonyms for the Information Resource 
Definition. ">
<text_body>Initially, the Registry will not have keyword, thesaurus, or ontology 
support but it will have a substring search for a number of fields, including definition. 
Therefore, we urge submitters to include enough expressive terms so that COE developers 
would easily find the term they might consider "natural" in the definition and find the 
desirable tag for expressing that concept. Example: If the 
registered tag is ORG_ID, the description that includes references</text_body>

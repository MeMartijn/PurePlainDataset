			<title>
				General
			</title>
			<p id="1.1.1">
				<text_body>
					This  specification  has  been  developed  within  UIC  Project  EIRENE.  It  specifies  the 
functional requirements for a digital radio standard for the European railways and is 
part of the Technical Specification for Interoperability. 
				</text_body>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p id="1.2">
			<title>
				Scope
			</title>
			<p id="1.2.1">
				<text_body>
					The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification defines the requirements of a radio 
system satisfying  the  mobile  communications  needs  of  the  European  railways .  It 
encompasses ground-train voice and data communications, together with the ground-
based mobile communications needs of trackside workers, station and depot staff and 
railway administrative and managerial personnel. 
				</text_body>
				<!--figure id="1-1"></figure-->
			</p>
			<p id="1.2.2">
				<text_body>
					The scope of this specification is to provide interoperability for trains and staff crossing 
national or other borders between systems, and to provide manufacturing economies 
of scale wherever practical. 
				</text_body>
			</p>
			<p id="1.2.3">
				<text_body>
					The  primary  objective  of  this  specification  is  to  ensure  interoperability  along 
international lines which are generally high speed and cross suburban areas with a 
high level of traffic. 
				</text_body>
			</p>
			<p id="1.2.4">
				<text_body>
					It is also important for this specification to provide an appropriate standard for future 
replacement of national radio systems operating on both important internal routes and 
low to medium traffic rural areas. It will be determined on a national basis whether 
different classes of service need to be defined for such routes.
				</text_body>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p id="1.3">
			<title>
			1.3     Applicability  
			</title>
			<p id="1.3.1">
				<text_body>
				1.3.1     The  EIRENE  Functional  Requirements  Specification  defines  a  set  of  requirements 
which a railway radio system should comply with, in order to facilitate international 
interoperability between national railways and manufacturing economies of scale. This 
specification therefore defines the functional requirements, to ensure that core railway 
functionality is provided. 
				</text_body>
			</p>
			<p id="1.3.2">
				<text_body>
				1.3.2     The specification distinguishes between the requirements affecting a railways network 
infrastructure,  onto  which  mobiles  will  roam,  and  the  requirements  concerning 
mobiles which will be used in any EIRENE-compliant network. 
				</text_body>
			</p>
			<p id="1.3.3">
				<text_body>
									1.3.3     The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: 
					<itemize>
						<item>
							     Mandatory (indicated by (M) at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory that  each railway meets these specifications on lines where interoperability is required. 
						</item>
						<item>
							     Optional  (indicated  by  (O)  at  the  end  of  the  paragraph).  Whilst  not  being  mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in  the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory,  both  to  provide  a  consistent  service  and  to  present  a  recognised  and  agreed  standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development  and manufacture. 
						</item>
						<item>
							     Information (indicated by (I) at the end of the paragraph). These are statements  intended to provide explanatory notes.

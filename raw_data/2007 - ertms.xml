<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="1.1">
<text_body>
This document defines the functional requirements for ERTMS/ETCS (EUROPEAN RAIL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM / EUROPEAN TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM). The document primarily defines the operational requirements and therefore contains only a few technical terms. For consistency reasons, all functional requirements not implemented in the SRS 2.3.0 have been removed from this version.
</text_body>

<p id="1.5">
<text_body>
In the requirements of this document:
<description>
	<item> (M) = Mandatory:The requirement shall be respected in every ETCS application. The applicable requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall be respected.</item>
	<item> (O) = Optional:It is not mandatory to implement this function in every ETCS application. If implemented, the applicable requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall be respected. Note that the CCS TSI may define specific conditions, where implementation of O functions may be required for safety reasons. </item>

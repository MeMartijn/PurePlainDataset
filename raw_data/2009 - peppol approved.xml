<title>Preface</title>
  <text_body>
    This preface provides a short overview about the comments received from the EC and other sources
    and how these comments and remarks will be taken into consideration in future/ongoing work.
    The review reflected that WP2 presents with its deliverable D2.1 “an ambitious, high quality vision,
    reflected in a 4 stage maturity model, which is well argued.” The general feedback received for this
    document was positive, especially highlighting various insightful remarks. On the other hand the
    review process has generated some criticism which will be addressed by WP2 in future works. The
    following description responds to these comments and criticism by arguing how and where revisions
    and updates of the work presented in this deliverable will be implemented in subsequent results of WP
    2.
    First of all, D2.1 will be updated and improved in the following respects:
    <itemize>
      <item>The executive summary will be elaborated and improved in the upcoming Version 1.2.</item>
      <item>The goals of chapter 3 will be described in more detail. The term “framework” thereby seems
        to be misleading and will be replaced by a more suitable expression. The general descriptions
        and structure of chapter 3 will be maintained. Responding to criticism from the review, strong
        interconnections will be added to the subsequent deliverable D2.2, which will give a more
        detailed description of the organisational, semantic, technical and legal specifications of the
        VCD concept. In D2.2., the requirements stated in D 2.1 will be reconsidered and transformed
        into a tabular collection of functional and non-functional requirements grouped for different
        components of the overall VCD concept (see subsequent contents of D 2.2)
      </item>
      <item>The conclusions will be amended in the upcoming Version 1.2 of D 2.1.</item>
    </itemize>
    A request was made to further detail the generic scope and nature of D2.1. WP 2 will respond to this
    request by adding interrelations of D2.1 with D2.2, which aims at the detailed specifications of the
    VCD concept, pilot and components. WP 2 planned the first deliverable as laying the basis for the
    subsequent detailed specifications, i.e. focus was put on the analysis and general concept of a VCD. It
    should be noted that such a VCD concept currently does not exist. Even in CEN BII, only an early draft
    of a qualification profile exists. Hence, the first specification document of WP 2 was dedicated to
    general analysis and overall concept with an analysis of requirements at organisational, semantic,
    technical and legal level. The subsequent deliverable D2.2 will convey the specifications and design of
    the individual VCD components, including the pilot designs, hence detailing and counterbalancing the
    requirements of D 2.1 with conceptual descriptions / specifications. The following components of the
    VCD implementation will be covered within D2.2:
    <itemize>
      <item>
        The pre-VCD mapping pilot (subsequently called European VCD service), which is a tool that
        informs an economic operator about what evidences s/he has to provide in order to comply
        with the selection and exclusion criteria set out in a call for tender or contract notice of a
        contracting authority in another country: This service will comprise of an ontology, an ontology
        manager and a VCD interaction tool, which does the reasoning (mapping) and provides the
        interface for a user to query the ontology for the mapping. The tool will furthermore generate a
        VCD package skeleton based on the VCD schema. With this structure, the VCD service
        provider can easily insert the evidences and pack everything into a VCD package for the
        requestor (economic operator).
      </item>
      <item>
        The VCD schema specification comprised of a logical data model and a physical
        representation in XML will be the standard format to ensure interoperable VCD package
        implementation.
      </item>
      <item>
        The VCD services which will compile VCD packages in five pilot member states (after the
        PEPPOL enlargement procedure, three new pilots have been added to WP 2): These VCD
        services will implement a number of services to query and collect evidences from different
        issuing bodies and to pack the individual evidences into a full VCD package thereby also
        extracting certain metadata and context specific data which will facilitate machine-readability
        and quick evaluation of a VCD package.
      </item>
      <item>
        Besides above technical specifications, the evaluation of legal compliance of these technical
        specifications is performed. The results of these evaluations will be fed into the specifications
        of the components indicated above.
      </item>
      <item>
        Likewise, organisational specifications will detail the processes of interaction between users,
        the scenarios for the production pilots, test and evaluation guidelines as well as business
        models of pilots, and governance and maintenance structures to ensure long-term
        sustainability.
      </item>
    </itemize>
    One of the comments was that a structured review of the state of practice is missing in this report.
    WP2 has strongly interconnected D2.1 to the state of practice report published by DG market1:
    'eCertificates' feasibility study (Preliminary study on the electronic provision of certificates and
    attestations usually required in public procurement procedures). In reference to this, D2.2 will
    comprise a short overview of the updated state of practice and the relation to current more detailed
    results of WP2.

  <title>Introduction: Motivation for a Virtual Company Dossier</title>
  <text_body>
    The effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enable interoperability in
    public procurement is an area of great significance for achieving the Lisbon objectives, i.e. to become
    the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world (EC 2005). However, the
    current European public eProcurement infrastructure is inappropriate because it is characterized by a
    high market fragmentation and a lack of interoperability. Hence, a major objective of the European
    Commission is to enable European-wide eProcurement across borders by creating common principles
    and technical solutions that are applied within all Member States. eProcurement requires efforts to be
    done by public administrations, in particular to exploit new technologies for interoperability that enable
    easy information accessibility, improving the availability of pan-European services and interaction
    among citizens and businesses (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004).
    Governments are the largest buyer in the European Union which purchase at a level of approximately
    15-20% of GDP (Ministerial_Declaration 2005). Governments are lagging behind major industries in
    exchanging relevant data with key actors such as suppliers. Common standards for electronic data
    exchange seem to be a key element for companies to participate in public eProcurement. A Europeanwide
    eProcurement infrastructure could save governments up to 5% on expenditure and the
    transaction costs for both buyers and suppliers could be reduced by 50-80%. A greater competition
    and efficiency in eProcurement will influence the whole economy and may also play an important role
    in achieving the Lisbon objectives, e.g. to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledgebased
    economy in the world (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004).
    The Manchester ministerial declaration of 24 November 2005 defines the target that
    ((Ministerial_Declaration 2005) p.4): “By 2010 all public administrations across Europe will have the
    capability of carrying out 100% of their procurement electronically, where legally permissible, thus
    creating a fairer and more transparent market for all companies independent of a company’s size or
    location within the single market. By 2010 at least 50% of public procurement above the EU public
    procurement threshold will be carried out electronically. Over the period 2006-2010 Member States
    will focus their efforts on delivering those high impact services in Europe which will contribute most to
    the achievement of the Lisbon Agenda.”
    It is expected that an interoperable eProcurement infrastructure ensures equal treatment and nondiscrimination
    and that it facilitates fairer and more effective competition in the European market by
    enabling suppliers to compete in an open and transparent way. However, current eProcurement
    infrastructures are inappropriate to reach this ambitious aim since these are characterized by a high
    market fragmentation. A lack of interoperability – different, non-operable and incompatible technical
    solutions – hinders suppliers in accessing eProcurement systems and discourages their participation
    cause of additional difficulties or increased costs (Commission_Staff_Working_Document
    08.07.2005).
    Across Europe, eProcurement systems have already been developed with a focus on the automation
    of different eProcurement procedures. Current systems reflect various country-specific public
    procurement needs and national laws, priorities, and practices. Systems are either centrally oriented
    or designed to reflect federated systems demands. In addition, varying terminologies are used within
    the European Member States. The lack of a unified eProcurement terminology is a major barrier which
    affects the possibility of a smooth collaboration between Member States and their eProcurement
    systems (Commission_of_the_European_Communitites 2004). Legal, technical and organisational
    barriers prevent the development of a common Procurement infrastructure and are one of the greatest
    challenges to be solved by politics, governments, ICT industry and research
    (European_Dynamics_S_A 2004).
    To facilitate EU-wide interoperability in public eProcurement, the European Commission co-funds the
    PEPPOL project in the ICT Policy Support Programme within the Competiveness and Innovation
    framework Programme (CIP). PEPPOL2 aims at setting up pan-European pilot solutions that
    conjointly exist with national infrastructures.
    Among the building blocks the PEPPOL consortium develops, the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD)
    focuses on an interoperable solution which contains the documents required from economic operators
    to evidence their qualification as well as qualitative selection or exclusion according to the directive
    2004/18/EC.
  </text_body>
  <p id="1.1">
    <title>Need for a Virtual Company Dossier </title>
    <text_body>
      A VCD will facilitate electronic Tendering by providing cross-border data and document solution that
      contains the necessary attestations and certificates typically required in eTendering. Thus it can be
      seen as a container for documents. Yet up to now, the tendering documents such as attestations and
      certificates required in public procurement procedures differ between Member States. When a
      contracting authority publishes a contract notice, it shall include the selection, qualification and nonexclusion
      criteria. The economic operators have to submit evidence and proof in respect of these
      criteria. Hence, during the preparation of the tender an economic operator needs to collect the
      respective evidences (i.e. certificates and qualification documents) from a number of issuing bodies
      (e.g. public registries, banks, pre-qualification bodies, etc.) to prove conformance with the given
      selection and exclusion criteria.
      The overall aims and expectations of a virtual company dossier solution as set out in the description of
      work can be described as follows:
      <itemize>
        <item>1. The VCD will support any authorised entities (economic operator, intermediary, contracting
          authority or IT service such as an eTendering system) in creating an electronic information
          package consisting of the required documentation, evidences, proof, attestations, certificates,
          declarations and metadata.
        </item>
        <item>2. In order to create the VCD, an implemented IT system will have to collect certificates and
          attestations from existing registries. It also enables the economic operator to add self-declarations
          or other documents of formal qualification.
        </item>
        <item>3. Furthermore, the VCD solution supports economic operators in producing a VCD and in enabling
          them to submit the required documentation (assembled as an information package) to any
          contracting authority in Europe.
        </item>
        <item> 4. In the same way the VCD as an implemented IT system will enable contracting authorities or their
          eTendering systems to interpret and accept the documentation submitted by the economic
          operator.
        </item>
        <item>
          5. Therefore the contracting authority must either specify the documentation that has to be submitted
          by economic operator or the criteria of qualitative selection and exclusion that have to be fulfilled
          by the economic operator.
        </item>
        <item>
          6. For all parties (economic operator, intermediary, contracting authority, issuing bodies) it will be of
          high importance that the VCD Service Providers are trustworthy; this implies that the services are
          precise, up-to-date, available and reliable.
        </item>
      </itemize>
      
      A major challenge of PEPPOLs’ work package 2 is to integrate various stakeholders in the
      development process and to set up an IT system which supports a common set of evidences based
      on electronic business certificates and qualification documents that are most frequently required. The
      criteria must be consistent with directive 2004/18/EC (EC 30.04.2004):
      
      <itemize>
        <item>Article 45 - Personal situation of the candidate or tenderer: e.g. absence of conviction,bankruptcy, fulfilment of payments of social security contributions or taxes, etc.</item>
        <item>Article 46 - suitability to pursue a professional activity: e.g. certificate of registration from thecommercial register</item>
        <item>Article 47 - economic and financial standing: e.g. balance sheets</item>
        <item>Article 48 - technical and/or professional ability of economic operators, e.g. certificates ofsatisfactory execution of past works</item>
        <item>Article 49 - quality assurance standards, e.g. ISO certificates</item>
        <item>Article 50 - environmental management standards</item>
        <item>(Article 51 - Additional documentation and information)</item>
      </itemize>

      Criteria are listed in the Directive and can be established by the contracting authority within the
      contract notice. A key aspect in the VCD development is to support a common set of criteria for
      qualitative selection and exclusion derived from the directive and their fulfilment through evidences.
      Work package 2 will not implement a common set of attestations. Thereby it must be taken into
      account that some countries do not issue such documents or certificates (e.g. in Norway extracts from
      the judicial record may be produced in respect of economic operators, but not in respect of private
      persons, for the purpose of a tender procedure) and this hinders economic operators to evidence
      certain criteria. In such cases, economic operators can only provide similar evidences that fulfil the
      same criteria. Where the country in question does not issue such documents or certificates, or where
      these do not cover all the cases they may be replaced by a declaration on oath, a solemn declaration,
      a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country whence
      that person comes. So the link between individual evidences and the respective criteria they may
      approve for (as listed above) must be precisely indicated and mapped in order to support economic
      operators in their activity.
      Besides the mapping of criteria and evidences in a respective country, directive 2004/18/EC indicates
      also the need for accessibility of “Official lists of approved economic operators and certification by
      bodies established under public or private law” (cf. Article 52). Article 52 indicates a potential solution
      which may be addressed in the VCD development too.

    <title>1.2 Status quo of evidencing selection and exclusion criteria in generic tendering procedure</title>
    <text_body>
      The status quo concerning the tendering process, observed in the European countries of this work
      package, is depicted in a generic status-quo procedure as shown in Figure 1.
      The procedure can be described as follows: A Contracting Authority prepares a call for tender
      based on a set of documents, usually consisting of a) the publication of a contract notice b) the tender
      contract documentation c) the (technical) specifications, d) additional documents. The contract notice
      is produced and transmitted to the official gazette such as the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) when
      due. It should be noted that for public tenders above a certain threshold, the publication in the Official
      Journal of the European Union (TED) is mandatory. Public tenders below that threshold can use other
      channels for the contract notice (depending on national legislation; e.g. contract notices may be
      mandatory in national official gazettes). Also tendering platforms can be used by the contracting
      authority (1). The steps of publishing the contract notice are part of “eNotification”3.
      An Economic Operator can use means such as the TED system, existing tendering platforms or
      official national gazettes to search for contract notices (2) and to retrieve the relevant information
      about active tenders (3). The online TED system provides broad advertising and presence of “contract
      notices” within the TED database. TED publications of contract notices usually contain the tender and
      contract documentation including detailed criteria, specifications and conditions. Almost all the TED’s
      contract notices have a summary of the requirements in other languages set by the Contracting
      Authority. The mandatory publication of contract notices in TED is a means to ensure transparency for
      public procurement throughout Europe and to enable a well functioning inner market. For contract
      notices below threshold, TED can also complement existing national sources through widespread
      information across borders. Sometimes, the information on a contract notice provided in TED is not
      complete. Hence, the Economic Operator must directly get the authentic contract notice and exact
      conditions from the Contracting Authority in order to avoid a failure on interpreting the requirements for
      participation.
      If an Economic Operator decides to participate in a public tender across border, the appropriate
      selection and exclusion criteria have to be evaluated. This means that the Economic Operator has to
      match these criteria set out in the contract notice of another country with the evidences (attestations,
      statements and certificates) of his or her own country in order to prove compliance (4). The attestations can be retrieved from the appropriate issuing bodies such as certifiers, source registers,
      banks, public authorities, etc. in the country where the Economic Operator is established (5).
      The step of retrieving proofs of suitability and non-exclusion and collecting documents for the receiving
      entities becomes a necessary task and may take place at different times. In some European Member
      State countries the “self-declaration” (a statement issued by the Economic Operator) is adopted to
      claim an initial suitability for applying and attending a tender. In this case, Economic Operators may
      retrieve their proofs of suitability only at a later stage if necessary at all.
      In most cases an official translation of the documents submitted by the Economic Operator is required
      (6). Some European countries are also imposing the submission of legally attested documents. In this
      case, accredited official translators, lawyers or notaries have to issue such legally attested translations
      of evidences.
      The following flows of documents have to be considered specifically:
      
      <itemize>
        <item>documents that cannot be generated in the target language by the originating authority;</item>
        <item>documents produced by the Economic Operator such as self declarations;</item>
        <item>documents that must be accessed by the contracting authority from the official source.</item>
      </itemize>

      Finally, the translated documents are submitted to the contracting authority (7) which checks their
      compliance with the appropriate (legal) requirements (8). Steps (7) and (8) are performed through
      separated incremental cycles according to the established practice in the country of execution. In
      some countries, the initial submission covers only the application with its set of declarations (twophased
      tendering). At a later stage and under an explicit request there is the real submission of the
      requested documents.
      To give a flavour of diverging procedures in regards to document handling (6) in WP 2 partner
      countries:
      European Member States such as France and Germany accept legally binding self-declarations.
      In Austria the current status is that each Economic Operator has to perform the full delivery of
      documents. In the case of a two-phased tendering (e.g. when negotiating with the Economic
      Operators), the submission of the documents is performed in the first phase. Each Economic Operator
      usually has to submit a full set of documents proving his suitability. Currently a new version of the
      Austrian Federal Procurement Act is elaborated which will probably change the necessity for the
      Economic Operator to just give a declaration on oath concerning the Economic Operator’s suitability.
      The contracting authority will demand the full list of documents (depending on the procurement
      process) just from those Economic Operator which either are selected for the second phase or which
      are selected as the winner(s) in a one-phase process. Summing up the document handling of different
      countries, in most countries the management of documents that bear legal validity falls into the
      general arena of public documents handling - that means: outside the pure procurement context.
      France follows a two step approach: the Economic Operator first sends his offer and the selfdeclarations
      (no bankruptcy, no conviction, compliance with employment obligations, etc.); the second
      sub-step concerns only the contractor and consists in sending social and fiscal attestations and, if
      necessary, the copy of the decision of the judicial procedure.
      Italy adopts the “DirectAccess” to documents and information records managed by public
      administrations. This solution removes from the Economic Operator the duty and burden to get and
      submit these specific attestations.
      Countries such as Norway may follow yet another approach by requesting a set of formal documents
      (i.e. those regulated by law) to be submitted by the Economic Operator at the time of the tender. Other
      documents, e.g. a bank guarantee if this is asked for, can be delivered later on in the procurement
      process.

  <title>Vision and Scope of the VCD</title>
  <p id="2.1">
    <title>Vision, Objectives and Maturity of the VCD</title>
    <p id="2.1.1">
      <title>Overall Vision of the VCD</title>
      <text_body>
        A major point of discussion is a sustainable and reliable long-term vision for exchanging attestations
        among Member States. In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the contracting
        authorities’ need to prove suitability and non-exclusion of economic operators according to certain
        criteria while reducing the burden of proof for the economic operator. This requires a paradigm shift
        towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and certificates that are
        currently just barely available in electronic form. The creation of uniform infrastructure in this
        heterogeneous domain will take some time as several different environments and stakeholders need
        to be involved, and change may not be enforceable to all of them. In this respect the VCD should
        support current practices of exchanging evidence in the short run and lead towards smooth, reliable
        and sustainable exchange of electronic evidences among Member States in the long run.
        In order to reach these goals we propose an approach with different stages of maturity that may be
        applied dependent on the readiness for the individual Member State. The aim is to support basic
        interoperability and exchange of documents on the lower maturity levels and leading towards direct
        electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity levels. Thereby each maturity level is built upon
        the lower ones thus allowing integration and step by step advancement.
        In the following we will introduce the staged maturity model for the VCD as depicted in Figure 2.
        The stages express different levels of maturity with respect to interoperability. A staged
        implementation approach is necessary in order to handle the complexity of the domain and to take into
        account the needs of the Member States. Every Member State should develop a solution that meets
        the demands of basic interoperability. Basic interoperability can thereby be defined as a state where
        organisational transparency of cross-border tendering requirements is established (stage 1- pre-VCD
        mapping tool). The efforts and expenses to develop a solution that ensures basic interoperability ought
        to be manageable and affordable.Member States, who would like to advance their solution towards a higher level of interoperability, can
        do so by adopting subsequent VCD maturity levels. The VCD specification must be generically and
        semantically extensible in order to reach a sustainable and fully-fledged solution in the final stage. An
        eTendering system and a contracting authority must be able to interpret a VCD package assembled by
        a VCD application regardless of the implementation stage of the VCD application and the eTendering
        system. Figure 2 illustrates the staged maturity model of the VCD that has been designed to show the
        different stages of implementation and development.
        In terms of construction and implementation, the VCD may be seen as a solution focusing on the
        European interoperability on the basis of European/national requirements and legislation. It is
        therefore necessary to ensure national transparency by gathering national requirements on certificates
        and qualification documents. The first implementation level (stage 1) is dependent upon these national
        requirements and will define a basic semantic interoperability model that supports the mutual
        recognition of certificates and qualification documents (pre-VCD mapping tool).
        The next step then is to define the structure of a VCD by adding several types of (meta)data into it
        (e.g. evidences, structural data of the evidences, translations etc.) and to build an application that is
        able to compile VCDs and enabling economic operators to submit this information electronically to
        contracting authorities (Stage 2).
        Stage 3 includes one of the most critical parts of a VCD which consist of making the evidences
        contained in a VCD comparable with regard to their contents to enable automated processing and
        understanding of its contents across borders (stage 3 – VCD advanced package). Beside this, stage 3
        will focus on additional services such as maintaining a VCD or composing a VCD from different
        economic operators in case of bidding consortia.
        Stage 4 (VCD networked package) will then provide a sophisticated method for changing the overall
        process from push to pull. A contracting authority will receive a VCD on the basis of stage 2 and 3
        (push) but the documents itself will not be submitted anymore. Instead a contracting authority can
        request those documents on demand from a database (pull) at national service provider who hosts
        VCD services, or directly from the very registration authority. The VCD networked package will provide
        the basis for further developments towards an electronic exchange of evidence.
        The stages follow a generic approach and may be seen as the evolution or development according to
        an underlying maturity model. The model as presented in Figure 2 is further described in the following
        subsection with the purpose to detail the various stages.
        For a future maturity path of a VCD Service one has to take into consideration the most important
        points of the vision and the goals of a VCD, which are:
        <itemize>
          <item> Compiling a VCD Package is a service supporting Economic Operators and/or Contracting Authorities in procurement procedures</item>
          <item>
            Future vision means a paradigm shift from handling of documents to the handling of
            information and the electronic exchange of information in order to establish interoperability on
            the basis of mutual recognition
          </item>
          <item>
            The real benefit could be gained when the VCD Package (which may be seen as a container for
            documents – structured or unstructured – and additional information) is complete and accurate.

        The following preconditions and assumptions that define the context of VCD Services and VCD

        <itemize>
          <item>
            Criteria for qualification and selection are in accordance with the Directives 2004/18/EC4,5(public

            An attestation is made up of one (or more) document(s) including machine interpretable data that

      <title>Level of Support and Level of Completeness (maturity model)</title>
      <text_body>
        In accordance to the above mentioned major visions and requirements two important dimensions are
        to be considered in order to assess the benefits of a VCD Service and a VCD Package (cf. Figure 3):
        <itemize>
          <item>The Level of support</item>
          <item>The Level of completeness</item>
       </itemize>
        Presenting these two dimensions in a matrix-chart may give an understanding of possible, pragmatic
        and practical development paths. The level that will be reached by a Member State and the path to go
        will depend upon the goals and decisions of each single Member State.

        <title>Level of Support given to economic operators and contracting authorities</title>
        <text_body>
          The different levels of support address both the maturity of the service and the maturity of the VCD
          package, where the latter corresponds to the semantic richness of the provided information. On the
          Peppol/WP2 strategy there is explicit interest to have parallel increments on both sides, assuming that
          the semantic enrichment of the VCD package requires a corresponding enriched supporting system.
          This means, the higher the level of support, the higher the interoperability between the Member States
          (enabled by richer semantics of the information provided in the VCD Package).
          Information Support: Provides information about criteria and attestations including.
          
          <itemize>
            <item>
              Which attestations, certificates or statements provide evidence for which criteria (making up the
              mapping), including the possibility of using self-declarations;
            </item>
            <item>
              How (i.e. the service) and from whom (e.g. issuing authority) the evidences are provided. Services
              can be human beings, organisations as well as IT-services.
              On this level of support the VCD rule set is defined as a reference model which is manually or semiautomatically
              consulted by the economic operator and/or the contracting authority. There are no VCD
              Services established which compile, validate or deliver VCD-Packages.
              Compilation Support: Helps the responsible player (in most cases the economic operator) to compile
              a VCD Package according to the defined definitions/regulations/rule set/model by means of a
              specialized VCD Service (not necessarily implying an IT-System):

          <itemize>
            <item>
              The evidences included in the VCD Package are digitally represented, yet the contents are not
              necessarily machine-processable;
            </item>
            <item>
              The individual evidences are enriched with additional descriptions/metadata (adding structural
              data of evidence);
            </item>
            <item>
              The VCD Package as a whole contains additional metadata, describing the VCD package itself
              (VCD package data, e.g. compilation date).
            </item>
          </itemize>
          On this level of support, the VCD Service can deduce from the provided structural metadata, whether
          the VCD Package is complete or not and if its evidences are valid or outdated.
          Decision Support: Decision Support enhances the compilation support by processing content- and
          context-specific data:
          <itemize>
            <item>
              Evidences are provided in a structured and machine interpretable form, at least those that can be
              easily transformed in such representation;
            </item>
            <item>
              The contracting authority may control whether or not the evidences prove the required criteria (as
              opposed to the level of compilation support, where one only could check if the VCD is complete
              and the attestations are valid).
            </item>
          </itemize>
          On this level of support, ALL necessary information (structural data of evidence and context specific
          data) of the included evidences are provided and the contracting authority is able to make a decision
          about the suitability of the economic operator.
        </text_body>

      <p id="2.1.3.2">
      <title>Level of Completeness </title>
        <text_body>
          A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested evidences (all that are necessary to
          prove all requested criteria) are contained in it. The range of evidences varies from self-declarations to
          official attestations or certificates issued by public authorities (see Figure 7 for a categorization). From
          a pragmatic point of view, it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of evidences in a first step and to
          complete the VCD Package later on. It is also reasonable to define a default package list that has to
          be provided in most public tenders by economic operators independently of particular criteria
          mentioned by the “Call for Tender”. This would reduce the burden of reading or interpreting the Call for
          Tender but would increase the need for interpreting other requirements and would not ensure a high
          level of completeness of a VCD. From these considerations we can derive the following approach:
          <itemize>
            <item>1. Create a VCD package;</item>
            <item>2. Focus on the evidences of criteria according to Articles 45 - 46 in the Directive 2004/18/EC7 first;</item>
            <item>3. Create a tender-specific VCD Package through interconnection of VCD and call for tender;</item>
            <item>
              4. Develop possibilities to map and add other documents (self declarations or statements from banks
              etc.) needed to proof criteria according to Articles 47 - 50 in the Directive 2004/18/EC later on in
              order to create a complete VCD-Package.

      <title>Criteria for qualification and selection and non-exclusion</title>
      <text_body>
        The criteria for qualitative selection and non-exclusion as defined in the Directive 2004/18/EC are the
        common ground for building a cross border VCD service. The figure below shows the relevant criteria
        as defined in Articles 45-50 as these are regarded the most common ground when mapping any
        national criteria to the European ones.
        Mapping evidences to the criteria stated in Articles 45 and 46 may be regarded as sufficient for a first
        step since these can be further described within sub criteria and related atomic criteria . The personal
        situation of a candidate (Article 45) can be for example further described by:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard to absence of conviction (sec. 45 §1 and §2 (c, d, g))
            <itemize>
              <item>Atomic criteria: has been convicted by final judgment of the participation in a criminal organisation</item>
              <item>Atomic criteria: has been convicted by final judgment of corruption</item>
              <item>Atomic criteria: has been convicted by final judgment of money laundering</item>
              <item>Atomic criteria: has been convicted of an offence concerning his professional conduct by a judgement which has the force of res judicata</item>
            </itemize>
          </item>
          <item>Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard to non-bankruptcy and financial status (sec. 45 §2 (ab))</item>
          <item>Sub criteria: Personal situation with regard compliance with fiscal and social obligations (sec. 45 §2 (e-f))</item>
        </itemize>
        A detailed mapping between those criteria mentioned in Articles 45 and 46 will enable a precise
        comparison between different tender specific requirements within the Member States enabling wide
        information support for both, economic operators and contracting authorities The mapping of other
        criteria (Article 47 to 50) may only be done on a high level (criteria and sub criteria) since these
        requirements typically differ too much. So there will be basic information and compilation support
        provided in a first step.
        Names, contents and qualities of VCD vary between countries, and in many cases economic
        operators are using the options of Article 51 to add additional up-to-date information from public
        registries.

      <title>Steps on the path of development</title>
      <text_body>
      <itemize>
        <item>
          National criteria and attestations: The first step delivers information on all the national attestations
          as well as on where and how to get them.
        </item>
        <item>
          European mapping, economic operator specific: The second step provides a mapping of national
          attestations which evidence criteria defined by Directive 2004/18/EC8, and with a particular focus
          on Articles 45 and 46. This is a first move towards cross-border interoperability.
        </item>
        <item>
          Extended European criteria set and mapping: The third step completes the information support by
          adding all the other criteria in Articles 47 to 50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC on a high level and
          where possible on sub criteria/atomic criteria level. At this step the economic operators are
          supported with all the necessary information for participating in cross border tenders.
        </item>
      </itemize>
        The third step is a minimum requirement to meet for all Member States participating in the PEPPOLVCD-
        project thus it can be defined as a common goal. It is a precondition to guarantee cross border
        interoperability. The reason to make this third step as a mandatory requirement to all is that the parties
        involved will now get a complete picture of all the necessary information (criteria, attestations and
        ways to get them) and the pilots can work in countries where the mapping has been defined even if
        there is no pilot existing. The mapping is necessary for a correct system specification and further
        development according to the overall maturity model enabling improvements with regard to level of
        support. A Member State may reduce the level of completeness with regard to compilation and
        decision support with regard to their Pilot, but information support should be provided to all criteria at
        least on a high level.
        Beyond the third step, every MS may decide which path to follow and which level to achieve. The path
        of development provides an idea of how to structure the national VCD project. One may decide to
        settle for the second level of support, but focus on the most commonly used attestations (a minimum
        for this level of support). A MS may next decide to stay there (no move), or to complete his service
        (move to the right) or to keep the narrow focus and head for the highest level of support (move
        upwards) (cf. Figure 2).

  <p id="2.2">
    <title>Pre-VCD mapping tool (Stage 1)</title>
    <text_body>
      The pre-VCD mapping tool introduces a procedure to collect information about the evidences for
      specific Call for Tenders. Thereby the Status quo procedure of section 1.2 remains unchanged, except
      that a pre-VCD mapping exists which is implemented and provided through a European service
      provider9 (see Figure 5). The mapping tool provides information to the economic operator on which
      national attestations of his or her country fulfill the criteria set by the procuring agency in the respective
      country (steps 4, 5). Likewise, the contracting authority can check evidences and authorizations
      provided by economic operators via the pre-VCD mapping tool (step 9).
      To fulfill a first precondition for a VCD package as introduced in Stages 2 and beyond, the pre-VCD
      mapping tool is the proposed function and the process that allows for its execution. It consists of a tool
      and of a data structure representing different contexts. These contexts are linked to the national public
      procurement domains and a single European common domain. For every domain we suppose to get a
      representation of a national index which provides an overview of national criteria demanded in public
      procurement, and how these are evidenced (i.e. which attestations and/or statements provide what
      evidence). This index also indicates structural data of evidence for example the issuer of the individual
      attestations or statements and the service it may activate for public or reserved access. In this respect,
      the European selection and exclusion criteria, which are derived from the European Directive
      2004/18/EC, can be considered the reference criteria, while the national criteria which are the basis for
      individual public tenders in respective countries are considered the local criteria. Figure 6 depicts the
      general taxonomy for the pre-VCD mapping concept, while Figure 7 shows a detailed taxonomy of the
      concept “evidence”. With this taxonomy, it is possible to map the fact that evidences can either be
      provided by the candidate himself (e.g. self-declaration, declaration on oath, solemn statement) or
      specific issuers as certified authorities and/or [authorized] third parties.
      Furthermore, evidences may be of different type such as statements, attestations or certificates, as
      indicated in Figure 7.
      Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to
      the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European
      exclusion and selection criteria.
      The respective retrieval of attestations and statements (6) and the subsequent steps (7-8) remain the
      ones as described in the status-quo description of section 1.2 above.

      <title>Vision statement</title>
      <text_body>
        Stage 1: Stage 1 can be seen as a minimal construction level. It implies the design and rolling out of a
        tool for supporting the basic interoperability between different legal conditions for providing evidence in
        public procurement procedures. As stated in the introduction, it can be seen as a minimum
        requirement for all Member States participating in the PEPPOL VCD work package.
        At this stage, a semantic model is introduced that supports guidance in applying the relevant
        community rules on mutual recognition of evidences (e.g. diplomas, certificates or other evidences of
        formal qualifications) in cross-border procurement procedures. The semantic model especially
        requires and provides for:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            a mapping between available national attestations and the selection and exclusion criteria set by
            the contracting authority through European criteria. These European criteria of selection and
            exclusion are directly derived from Articles 45-50 of directive 2004/18/EC;
          </item>
          <item>a provision of alternative means for evidencing criteria, when foreign economic operators areconsidered;</item>
          <item>a tool to facilitate identification of evidences needed across countries, and the respective up-todate mappings.</item>
        </itemize>
        The starting point for stage 1 is the mapping of common European criteria of qualitative selection and
        exclusion to the national criteria and the attestations giving evidence to these criteria. As European
        criteria are the same for all Member States, they act as the pivot element for the mapping. The
        semantic model therewith is able to clarify the relationship between national attestations of similar type
        and the kind of criteria those documents refer to.10
        The pre-VCD mapping is implemented through a respective pre-VCD mapping tool, which supports a
        tendering interaction in the following ways:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            An economic operator participating in a tender of a foreign country can quite easily understand the
            requirements (what criteria have to be fulfilled) and decide which are the best national attestations
            (self declarations included) to prove the criteria requested by the contracting authority.
          </item>
          <item>
            The contracting authority can check through the same mapping mechanism whether the submitted
            attestations express fulfilment with the relevant criteria or requirements.
          </item>
          <item>
            The contracting authority can activate a direct access to attestations that are exposed through
            open services, including the international cross-linking.
          </item>
        </itemize>
        Table 1 provides an overview of the outcome, approach, benefits and necessary efforts or limitations
        of the pre-VCD mapping.

      <title>Use Case description</title>
      <text_body>
        The use case diagram in Figure 8 shows the main actors and functions of stage 1 (pre-VCD mapping)
        in the context of a public tender.
        A contracting authority sends a notification on a Call for Tender to a Publication body that publishes
        the call. The Call for Tender contains the definition of evidences and the specific criteria on qualitative
        selection and exclusion that are relevant to this particular call.
        If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular Call for Tender he can directly retrieve
        relevant information about evidences and criteria by using the information published in the Call for
        Tender. In cases below threshold or in the cases where the public notice is partial, the economic
        operator might send a direct request to the contracting authority in order to retrieve the required
        information. Having the relevant criteria in place the economic operator will be enabled to get a
        mapping to the national attestations that refer to those criteria via the pre-VCD mapping tool. Thesame process can be performed by the contracting authority in order to check whether the submitted
        attestations adequately fulfil certain criteria asked for.
        The pre-condition to the above flow of events is represented by the formal representation of imposed
        criteria, in particular for the qualification segments affecting, the technical, the financial and the quality
        criteria (as per directive 2004/18/EC_Arts. 47-50). Such formal representation has to be addressed
        along with the setting of the tool.
        Besides the use of the pre-VCD mapping in actual tendering and procurement procedures, a “system”
        needs to be maintained which implements the mapping of European and national laws, and the
        agreements of mutual recognition among Member States (see use-case diagram depicted in Figure 9).

        selection and exclusion derived from Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC and the national
        attestations giving evidence to these criteria. To handle the large set of ruling articles, which may
        especially vary in the national implementations (articles 47-50), arts 45 and 46 shall get a higher
        priority for a smooth implementation at first hand, while arts 47 to 50 will only be selectively
        implemented on the basis of specific and deeper analysis in the PEPPOL pilot contexts. Due to the
        diversity and variability of evidences according to Art 51, this criterion will receive least priority in the
        implementations (if at all taken into consideration).
        This mapping includes at first hand an overview and transparency among national evidences and
        European criteria as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 above, including information about who issues
        specific evidence. Further on, this mapping needs to be implemented in the pre-VCD mapping tool as
        depicted in the use-case diagram in Figure 9, i.e. a list of criteria to be matched is submitted to the
        entity performing the mapping. Using the underlying technology, the mapping is done and its results,
        consisting of a list of the attestations giving evidence to the demanded criteria, can be transferred to a
        requester in case of a public tender.
        Requirements for the pre-VCD mapping tool
        The following requirements can be derived for stage 1:

        <title>Create standard representation of European criteria of qualitative selection andexclusion</title>
        <text_body>
          A major precondition for the enforcement of stage 1 is the definition of a standard representation of
          European criteria for qualitative selection and exclusion. These criteria should be derived directly from
          09/11/2009 – version 1.1 (approved by EC)
          the Articles 45-50 of the Directive 2004/18/EC in order to ensure employment in Pan-European public
          procurement procedures. The right granularity and consistency of criteria will be important to ensure
          legitimacy and to retrieve adequate mapping results. Thus the criteria may have to be iteratively redefined
          according to the results given by specific mappings.

        <title>Specify an infrastructure and facility that provides the mapping service</title>
        <text_body>
          The commonly approved national mappings have to be made accessible to the different stakeholders
          as especially economic operators, contracting authorities and national VCD service providers. For that
          purpose, a basic infrastructure or system architecture or a mapping facility has to be defined. The
          mapping facility, independent of how such as “system” is actually implemented, has to provide the
          services with regard to the pre-VCD mapping tool
          <itemize>
            <item>
              Centralized or decentralized infrastructure? Will there be one centralized system on a
              European level hosting and providing the mapping or a decentralized system consisting of
              interconnected national systems? In the latter case, one could define that each national system
              only hosts the national mapping or that each one hosts all the different national mappings which
              would make a synchronization of the different systems necessary.
              A decision to deploy either a centralised or a decentralized infrastructure that provides the
              mapping service MUST be made.
            </item>
            <item>
              By which technical means will the mapping be provided? The technical means to provide the
              mapping service has to be defined in dependence on the choice of the pilot solution. The simplest
              form without any technical support could for example consist in the one-time distribution of
              mapping tables in paper-based form. Another solution could consist of a web-based access to a
              system providing the mapping by querying an underlying database which contains the mapping
              table. A more advanced solution would be an automated processing of the mapping according to
              the relevant criteria that therefore have to be specified by the contracting authority in a dedicated
              electronic format. Also the higher maturity levels defined in this vision (stage 2-4) can use the
              mapping service in order to retrieve the mapping information.

              how changes are applied to the system. Moreover an organisation or institution that governs the
              process of change management has to be defined.

          mapping model defined in this stage. Thus this stage will ensure the integration of different stages and
          interoperability as such. Therefore each national service provider that provides a VCD (stage 2-4) and
          all relevant key other stakeholder such as economic operators, contracting authorities and certifiers
          must be able to retrieve the latest mapping information from the mapping facility.

        <title>Requirements regarding a Pre-VCD mapping tool</title>

          maintenance, authenticity, actuality, compliance of mapping to laws and national structures, etc. The
          pre-VCD mapping tool has to be accredited by the European Union and the Member States.
          A number of functionalities of the mapping tool are:

              query the pre-VCD mapping tool in order to understand what evidences he can deliver to confer to
              the selection and exclusion criteria set in a public tender in another Member State.
            </item>
            <item>
              The results are delivered in a format simple to use for the economic operators; e.g. a check list of
              evidences he can collect from respective issuing bodies in his country, which fulfil the selection
              criteria and prove the non-conformance with exclusion criteria set by the contracting authority from
              a different Member State.

          </itemize>

            <item>
              The Member States need to update the mapping in case of any change within a short time frame

      <title>Expected Benefits for stakeholders</title>
      <text_body>
        The pre-VCD mapping is the prerequisite for the VCD packages described in the subsequent stages. It
        requires that the European criteria and national criteria have to be elaborated and agreed upon by the
        different Member States. The major advantage and benefits of stage 1 are as follows:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            The major benefit for economic operators lies in the fact that an automatic mapping of criteria to
            national evidences is provided through a pre-VCD mapping tool, thus omitting the need for a
            manual and error-prone selection of appropriate evidences for a particular Call for Tender. The
            mapping guarantees that the submitted attestations are mutually recognized if they correspond to
            the mapping information given by the system. The mutual recognition implies a formal
            commitment by contracting authorities that take part of the service chain, or alternatively by a legal
            enforcement operated by qualified entities. The formal commitment must in turn specify what is
            taken as pure guidance or qualified template.
          </item>
          <item>
            The contracting authority can as well use the mapping in order to check if the attestations
            handed in by an economic operator of another country are sufficiently evidencing those selection
            and exclusion criteria defined for the tender.
          </item>
          <item>
            Through the pre-VCD mapping model, it will also be possible to identify the major issuing bodies
            of particular evidence. Nevertheless this function will not be available for all kinds of attestation
            since there may be too many issuing bodies that provide attestations of the same type (e.g. for
            criteria to prove the economic standing of a candidate or economic operator).
          </item>
          <item>
            Through the pre-VCD mapping tool, both the economic operator and the contracting authority
            save time and money because they need not to find out by themselves
            <itemize>
              <item>
                how the attestations and statements existing in the economic operator’s country can fulfill the
                criteria demanded by the procuring agency of another country.

            Through the pre-VCD mapping and pre-VCD mapping tool, higher transparency and better
            information quality is provided for both of the actors, economic operator and economic operator).
            Overall, the pre-VCD mapping tool supports in the proof of compliance of evidences of one country to
            the requested selection and exclusion criteria of another country via a mapping to the European
            exclusion and selection criteria.

      <title>Scope, Limitations, Assumptions and Dependencies</title>
      <text_body>
        As mentioned in the vision statement, this stage focuses on the preconditions for a VCD package, and
        hence provides only limited functionality. A mapping system is introduced, allowing the mapping of
        criteria to national evidences, thus omitting cumbersome manual and potentially error-prone selection
        of attestations/evidences by the economic operator across borders.
        The following statements describe the limitations of this stage, i.e. the functions that are not covered
        by this stage:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            The economic operator is not supported in retrieving and collecting the required attestations from
            the appropriate bodies;
          </item>
          <item>
            A translation of the documents is not provided. All documents to be transferred to a foreign
            contracting authority still have to be translated by a certified translator into the appropriate target
            language, if requested by the contracting authority.
          </item>
          <item>
            In this stage the economic operator is not supported in creating a VCD package that follows a
            common logic. The VCD package compilation has to be performed by the economic operator
            himself (it is offered in the next stage of the VCD four-stage-model).
          </item>
          <item>
            There is a quality issue to be addressed concerning the acquisition of data for the knowledge
            base, i.e. the data supporting the operations of the tool. Qualified input sources are temporarily
            defined and approved within a close group of stakeholders.
          </item>
        </itemize>
        The following statements reflect assumptions made for stage 1 and dependencies with other stages:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            Every higher stage depends on the mapping model defined in the pre-VCD mapping stage. Thus
            this stage will ensure the integration of different stages and semantic interoperability in terms of
            mutual recognition.
          </item>
          <item>The contracting authority and economic operator can only retrieve information about the issuing
            bodies of particular evidences when a Member State has specified accredited public issuing
            bodies and recognized private issuing bodies within the national part of the pre-VCD mapping.

    <title>VCD simple package (Stage 2)</title>
    <p id="2.3.1">
      <title>Vision Statement</title>
      <text_body>
        Stage 2 requires the establishment of a national VCD service provider which hosts the VCD system in
        order to provide economic operators with the services necessary to create an early VCD package.
        Thus, in stage 2, the concept of a VCD package is introduced. The national VCD service provider
        operates the VCD system and takes the role of a trusted third party (TTP) whose services can be
        partially trusted by contracting authorities. The VCD package relies on a set of automated, semiautomated
        and manual issuing services which are collected by the VCD system. Thereby issuing
        services that are automated through a direct access to national issuing bodies are reliable to the
        contracting authority while manual and semi-automated issuing service that have to be provided by the
        economic operator are not under control of the national VCD service provider. The VCD system wants
        to ensure completeness of a VCD package by acting as a single-point of contact for the economic
        operator that supports him in creating a VCD package from various sources.
        The VCD system in stage 2 will be capable to compile a VCD package from different types of data.
        Stage 2 defines the basic structure of a VCD package by including these types of data that give
        evidence for the suitability of an economic operator. Therewith the contracting authority will be enabled
        to check the validity of the evidences contained within the VCD and whether the requested evidence
        adequately represents the fulfilment of the demanded criteria. Thereby translation of evidences may
        be still necessary and has to be performed by the economic operator in dependence on national legal
        and organizational requirements because the VCD package does not provide any standardised
        context-specific data which provide common semantics. Checks concerning the content of the
        evidences are therewith not possible in this stage, as there is no context specific data available.
        Nevertheless a VCD simple package provides a set of other types of data that are introduced in the list
        below:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            Structural VCD package data: Data that describes the VCD-Package as a whole, e.g. VCD Unique
            Identifier, VCD issuing time, VCD service provider etc.
          </item>
          <item>
            Tender specific evidence: Data that describe tender specific aspects e.g. TED id of the tender,
            criteria fulfilled by the evidence contained etc.
          </item>
          <item>
            Economic operator evidence: Data describing the individual situation of the economic operator
            e.g. name of economic operator, commercial register number, VAT number, etc.
          </item>
          <item>
            Structural data of evidence: Data generically describing evidence on a level detached from the
            semantic of its content e.g. DocName, DocLanguage, DocIssue date, DocExpiration date etc.
          </item>
          <item>
            Evidences: Attestations and candidate statements in form of files included in the VCD package
            e.g. excerpts from the commercial register, criminal records, self-declarations etc.
          </item>
          <item>
            Translations: Translations of attestations included within the VCD e.g. official translation of
            the excerpt from the commercial register, translation of criminal record etc.
          </item>
        </itemize>
        The types of data listed above have to be defined and agreed by the members of this work package in
        order to create a common structure of a VCD package. Furthermore the VCD package needs to
        provide the ability to be human readable thus a VCD viewing system is introduced in this stage too. In
        order to enable the economic operator to send the VCD simple package to any contracting authority
        stage 2 introduces the VCD transportation system which is strongly connected to the PEPPOL
        infrastructure proposed by WP8. The implementation of interfaces to tendering platforms, which
        typically should be capable to receive VCD packages, therefore should be encouraged. All activities
        above need to be adequately monitored through identity and access management since a lot of
        sensitive data is exchanged between the actors involved, thus stage 2 defines major requirements in
        this context.

    <p id="2.3.2">
      <title>Use Case description of VCD simple package (Stage 2)</title>
      <text_body>
        The use case description of stage 2 contains several sub-diagrams that describe interactions that are
        needed firstly to authenticate to the systems and secondly to create, transport and view a VCD simple
        package. Figure 10 contains a general overview of the following systems and actors affected within
        the use case VCD simple package of stage 2 (VCD simple package):
        <itemize>
          <item>Identity and access management: Economic operator; Officer,</item>
          <item>VCD system: Economic operator, Issuing body</item>
          <item>VCD transportation system: Economic operator, Contracting authority</item>
          <item>VCD translations system: Translator</item>
          <item>VCD viewing system: Economic Operator, Contracting authority</item>
        </itemize>
        It is important to emphasize that the systems described by the use case diagrams are systems that
        are logically different but not necessarily physically different. For example the VCD viewing system
        and the VCD system may be implemented as a single physical unit; they are logically different as
        shown in the use case diagram below. In contrast, if there are physically different systems a singlesign-
        on functionality should be used in order to increase the usability of the connected systems for the
        user. For example the logical systems identity and access management is strongly connected to the
        VCD system, to the VCD viewing system and the VCD transportation system and in particular refers to
        PEPPOL infrastructure proposed by WP8 and to already existing infrastructures within the Member
        States. In order to increase the overall usability for the actors, a single-sign-on should be implemented
        in order to connect authentication among different systems affected by identity and access
        management.
        Members that do already have system in place (e.g. for identity and access management) should utilize
        these infrastructures in order to lower the implementation efforts and to increase the acceptance
        among stakeholders affected by these systems. Thus the systems below do not require to be
        implemented in a uniform manner and several implementation variations may be possible.
        The use case VCD package is affected by four different systems. The overall pre-condition to access
        the VCD system is that the Economic Operator has previously been authenticated so that the VCD
        system can check appropriate user rights within identity and access management. Identity and access
        management is required to be done externally in a manual process that will verify the requestor’s
        identity before providing user rights and access. The VCD system itself involves two major actors.
        Economic operators act as requestors by authenticating to the VCD system, creating/recompiling a
        VCD simple package and retrieving this package from the VCD system. In contrast issuing bodies
        provide evidences to the system. Most Member States require that evidences are provided in the
        target language, thus a translator may have to translate evidences within the external VCD translation system. 
        The VCD transportation system is used to submit the VCD to the contracting authorities.
        Contracting authorities can then authenticate and use the VCD viewing system to access and view the
        VCD package.

      <p id="2.3.2.1">
        <title>Identity and access management</title>
        <text_body>
          The Identity and access management is an official procedure that handles roles for authorisation
          external to the VCD system and involves three actors, the economic operator, an officer and the VCD
          system itself as shown in Figure 11.
          Economic operators have to apply for a VCD account and therefore they have to provide sensitive
          economic operator data (for example by uploading attestations to verify these data). Sensitive
          economic operator data must initially be provided by an economic operator (e.g. company registration
          number, VAT number, social insurance number of the company etc.) in order to create an account and
          to start any VCD packaging service. An officer has to verify whether the provided data belongs to the
          economic operator and has to assure its correctness because either the VCD packaging service would
          not work or would deliver incomplete or wrong results. After verification the officer creates a VCD
          account where sufficient data about the economic operator is stored. In addition, identity and access
          management requires the possibility to delete an account within the VCD system and an official
          procedure to apply for a modification of the VCD account. An economic operator can authenticate to
          the VCD system only when the economic operator has sufficient user rights (e.g. authorized
          representative of economic operator) provided by identity and access management as shown in Figure
          12.

      </p>
      <p id="2.3.2.2">
        <title>VCD system</title>
        <text_body>
          After authentication the economic operator can provide further tender specific data to the VCD system
          (e.g. TED ID) in order to start the creation of a VCD simple package. The VCD system creates a
          suggestion for compilation according to the results provided by the pre-VCD mapping tool and in turn
          the economic operator can edit and confirm the compilation suggestion that is given by the VCD
          system as shown in Figure 13.
          The function of creating a VCD package includes the collection of evidence (including translations)
          and structural evidence data through several sources. Evidence and structural evidence data is
          provided by issuing bodies which can submit evidence and structural evidence data to the VCD
          system via an interface. An important remark therefore is that economic operators can take the role of
          an issuing body by submitting for example candidate statements, manually collected evidence or
          translations of evidence. The interface to submit evidence is defined through a service definition that
          allows adding specific structural evidence data that belongs to that evidence. The collection of
          evidence is finalized when all required evidences are submitted and this requires waiting for those
          evidences that have to be provided manually or semi-automatically. The VCD system can now compile 
          the VCD package and creates a set of structural VCD package data that belong to the compilation
          process.
        </text_body>
      </p> 
      <p id="2.3.2.3">
        <title>VCD transportation system</title>
        <text_body>
          The economic operator can submit the VCD simple package to the contraction authority by using the
          VCD transportation system which is part of the PEPPOL infrastructure. For using the VCD
          transportation system of WP8, both economic operators and contracting authorities have to
          authenticate to have access. An important remark hereby is the usage of procurement platforms
          where bids are typically uploaded according to a given Call for Tender. The transportation system of
          WP8 used by the VCD should be able to provide a possibility to send the VCD package directly to the
          contracting authority either by utilizing the upload functionality of a procurement platform or by directly
          sending the VCD to the contracting authority by using other means provided by the transportation
          system or typically used by the contracting authority. It is also important to state that the transportation
          system does not necessarily have to be used by the economic operator. The economic operator
          receives a VCD package by the VCD system and it is up to his choice how to submit the VCD package
          to the contracting authority.
        </text_body>

      <p id="2.3.2.4">
        <title>CD viewing system</title>
        <text_body>
          After retrieving the VCD package from economic operators, contracting authorities may have to
          authenticate to the VCD viewing system in order to view the VCD package. In contrast economic
          operators do not have to authenticate to the VCD viewing system because they are taking the role of
          an owner of the VCD package.
          The VCD viewing system has to fulfil certain sub-functionalities for displaying the different kinds of
          data that are contained within a VCD package. In stage 2 the viewing system should provide the
          possibility to view the following types of data (see Figure 14):
          <itemize>
            <item>Structural VCD package data (e.g. the creation date of the VCD),</item>
            <item>Tender specific evidence (e.g. the TED ID to which the VCD package is related to),</item>
            <item>Economic operator data (e.g. name of an Economic Operator),</item>
            <item>Structural data of evidence (e.g. document name)</item>
            <item>The evidences (e.g. criminal record)</item>
            <item>A translation of the evidences (e.g. certified translation of a criminal record)</item>
          </itemize>
          At this stage, the semantic model is enhanced through structural VCD package data, economic
          operator data, tender specific data and structural data of evidence.
          09/11/2009 – version 1.1 (approved by EC)
          The structural VCD package data describes the package (e.g. VCD issuer, VCD issuing time, schema
          version etc.) and is provided by the VCD service provider. Economic operator data is data that can
          initially be provided by an economic operator (e.g. company registration number, VAT number, social
          insurance number of the company etc.) to start the VCD packaging service. We suggest that the
          provision of economic operator data for economic operators that represent a consortium will be
          covered in stage 3. Economic operator data is the information needed to start the process and the
          economic operator thereby has to assure the correctness of its data because either the packaging
          service would not work or would deliver incomplete results. There needs to be a specific registration
          procedure where an economic operator provides economic operator data to the VCD service provider
          in order to create an account. The VCD service provider then creates an account for the economic
          operator where sufficient economic operator data is stored in order to retrieve attestations. An official
          procedure has to be defined to change this economic operator data to ensure updated economic
          operator data.
          In contrast tender specific data provides data that is connected to a specific Call for Tender (e.g. TED
          id of the tender, Subset of criteria etc.) comes either from another system (e.g. TED) or has to be
          provided manually by the economic operator. Structural data of evidences describes attestations on a
          level detached of the semantic of its content itself (e.g. ItemName, DocName, DocTitle, DocLanguage,
          DocFormat, DocID, DocIssue date, DocExpiration date)

      <title>Expected Benefits for stakeholders</title>
      <text_body>
        Table 3 shows the additional benefits of stage 2 (first stage in four-stage VCD concept containing documents):
      </text_body>
      <p id="Table 3"></p>
    </p>  
    <p id="2.3.5">
      <title>Scope, Limitations, Assumptions and Dependencies</title>
      <text_body>
        The major aim of stage 2 is to draft logical systems that enable economic operators to create simple
        VCD packages and to submit them to contracting authorities. Thereby stage 2 focuses on the
        necessary different logical systems that either provide major functionalities with regard to creating and
        viewing a VCD packages (VCD system) or which support the entire process such as authentication
        (Identity and Access management), transportation (VCD transportations system) or translation (VCD
        translation system). The general assumption of stage 2 is that the former pre-VCD mapping tool (stage
        1) will be utilized as a module that is adequately integrated into the VCD system.
        Stage 2 also introduces the idea of a national VCD service provider which operates the different
        services necessary to create and view a VCD package. The national VCD service provider will provide
        a single-point of access to several attestations and issuing services that are electronically available.
        Nevertheless it will be necessary to include other evidences that have to be provided semiautomatically
        or manually by the economic operator. It also cannot be guaranteed that each
        evidentiary document required according to the criteria stated in the Call for Tender by the contracting
        authority can be pointed at with a particular mapping results of the pre-VCD mapping tool since some
        evidence diverge too much in their contents and scope. In those cases the VCD system will provide
        the possibility to add those documents into the VCD simple package through placeholders which may
        09/11/2009 – version 1.1 (approved by EC)
        have a very generic grounding for mapping defined through an abstract class of documents (e.g.
        evidence with regards to environmental management standards). When summarizing those points it
        can be generally stated that a VCD at stage 2 and beyond still relies on several manual processes that
        have to be generated by the economic operator and which cannot be automated in short or medium
        term. However, a reduced scope of a VCD is necessary in order to provide the possibility to submit a
        VCD that has a sufficient level of completeness.
        Another aim of stage 2 is to differentiate, define and structure the types of data that will constitute a
        VCD package. Stage 2 does not focus on the re-development of existing evidentiary documents but
        on their extension through a common standard representation within a VCD. The VCD package
        contains similar structural fields which likewise describe the evidences contained in it in similar
        manner, order and style. Having similar structural layout of a VCD it will be easier to understand the
        contents of it and potentially to translated those structural key information from the language of the
        issuer or economic to the language of the contracting authority. Nevertheless a translation of the
        contents of evidentiary documents is not focussed at in this stage and has to be provided manually by
        the economic operator through adding translations into the VCD simple package.
        Stage 2 lays the ground for the further development of a VCD package towards an advanced package
        within stages 3. The VCD package only focus on major functions that are necessary to create such a
        package and doesn’t make use of other service that are introduced in the subsequent phases such as,
        recompiling an existing VCD package, usage of context-specific data and merging VCD packages of
        different economic operators into a single one. The recompilation of existing VCD packages increases
        the maintainability of a VCD for the economic operator by for example indicating which evidence has
        to be replaced by a new one and which evidence has to be additionally provided in case preparing a
        bid for a different Call for Tender. The usage of context-specific data thereby is an important precondition
        since these data can provide real-time information about the status of contents of the VCD
        which is needed in terms of making update proposals. Also the merging of different VCD packages
        into a single unit to be used when consortia which prepare a bid as a multi-party group is not
        addressed in stage 2.

      <title>Vision Statement</title>
      <text_body>
        Stage 3 represents a further step towards an optimised support for economic operators and
        contracting authorities. It is based on the features and functionalities of stage 2 and adds additional
        main features:
        <itemize>
          <item>recompiling an already existing VCD package</item>
          <item>merging data of several consortium members into one VCD package</item> 
          <item>embedding of context-specific data</item>
        </itemize>
        With regard to the idea of increasing the “level of support” for the actors (as explained in the
        introduction chapter) it is clear that the functionalities "Merging" and "Recompiling" enhance the
        capability of a VCD system of stage 2 in terms of compilation support while the new functionality
        "Embedding context specific data" is a tremendous improvement in terms of decision support.
        Recompiling an already existing VCD package
        Recompilation services provide functionalities that enable the reuse of evidences as well as their
        additional data of already existing VCD packages. This functionality is useful for several reasons:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            Updating an existing VCD package whenever one or more evidences are outdated. This could be
            done by checking whether evidences are outdated or not, retrieving the outdated evidences again
            and creating a new VCD package, which then contains the newly obtained evidences and those
            evidences from the original VCD, which are still valid.
          </item>
          <item>Creating a new VCD package on the base of an already existing VCD package of the same economic operator for a different tender.</item>
        </itemize>
        Merging data of several consortium members into one VCD package
        Stage 2 concentrates on cases with a "single legal entity" as the economic operator. For more
        complex constructions like consortiums, syndicate, joint ventures, contractor-subcontractorrelationships
        and so on, a merged VCD would be sufficient. Stage 3 introduces the functionality of
        providing a single VCD package for the economic operator regardless of whether the economic
        operator is a "single legal entity" or consists of several legal entities like a consortium, syndicate or
        joint venture.
        To create a single VCD package for consortia requires that additional information has to be provided
        by the economic operator: based on the fact whether a consortium partner acts in the form of a
        subcontractor for a very specialised task or as a partner having equal rights a different set of
        evidences might have to be provided for every partner/subcontractor.
        Embedding of context specific data
        Stage 2 delivers a VCD package containing required evidences as well as different kinds of data such
        as structural metadata, economic operator data or structural VCD package data. Stage 3 enhances
        the level of support (as explained in the introduction chapter) and offers decision support describing
        the major content of an evidence through context-specific data. This gives additional support to the
        contracting authority when deciding whether an economic operator is suitable or not. This happens by
        adding context specific data i.e. relevant data extracted from the provided evidences.
        The context specific data is provided by an issuing body through an interface in a machine
        interpretable form and displayed in a way the contracting authority (and the economic operator as well,
        of course) can see. This should happen by exposing the most relevant key information of a given
        evidence at one glance. In most cases the contracting authority does not have to view the delivered
        evidence in every detail to come to a decision. As context specific data follows a common and agreed
        schema, translation of evidences might by unnecessary. Generally speaking, we may say that the
        behaviour of contracting authorities cannot be driven or altered by the service solutions released by
        PEPPOL, so the checking strategy is part of their undisputable decision, nonetheless every newly
        added feature aiming at the simplification of their duties can really be welcomed.
        When the context specific data cannot be provided by an issuing services in a machine interpretable
        form, there might be the necessity of contributions from the economic operator to complete context
        specific data or even the national VCD service providers who acts as intermediary (e.g. Trusted Third
        Party) and may approve those data (scope of stage 4). If the national VCD service provider takes the
        role of a Trusted Third Party who approves context specific data this will effect the cooperation and
        requires a specific management under a trust and liability schema.
        At this stage the VCD service of stage 2 is enhanced by additional functionality ("Merging" and
        "Recompiling"). The compiled VCD package contains the digital copy of evidences (possibly in various
        formats) and structural data of evidences as in stage 2. But at the same stage the VCD service could
        offer additional support (decision support by embedding context specific data) that means a VCD
        package could contain the digital copy of evidences (possibly in various formats) and structural data of
        evidences as in stage 2 augmented by context specific data. So it has to be carefully elaborated what
        kind of additional functionality or support should be implemented and what will be the scope of context
        specific data in terms of a VCD package.
        Table 4 gives a summary of introduced features by the current VCD Stage 3.

          The stage 2-collection process for evidence and structural evidence data has to be extended to

          specific data are:
          <itemize>
            <item>
              Automated context specific data provision: extraction of data from structured evidence artefacts
              which are machine interpretable (e.g. XML) and which have been generated by an IT-system, if
              the structure is consistent with an agreed upon schema.
            </item>
            <item>
              Semi-automated context specific data provision: data is provided by a human being of the issuing
              service by filling in values in a structured, pre-defined template. This template can be a web-form,
              an XML-file consistent with an agreed upon XML-scheme, or other structured data sheets. The
              availability of an adequate user interface for providing the data values is an important issue of this
              approach
            </item>
            <item>
              Manual context specific data provision: data is provided by the issuing services in any
              unstructured format (e.g. scanned copies, text documents). A human being of the national VCD
              service provider manually extracts the data and provides it to the system using the mechanisms
              described in “Semi-automated context specific data provision”. This approach requires an
              additional level of trust into the national VCD service provider acting as Trusted Third party as he
              will be responsible for the correctness of the context specific data itself and not just only for the
              compliance of the processes, which are executed by the VCD services.

        <title>Context specific data</title>
        <text_body>
          A major feature of a stage 3 VCD advanced package is the introduction of context specific data. These
          data fields are specified in an agreed upon data schema and describe the content of an evidence or
          parts of its content under a predefined selection schema. The benefit of using context specific data is
          to avoid the necessity to read through the original version or a translated version of an evidence in
          order to obtain the information which is necessary to decide, whether a criterion is satisfied or not and
          thereby having a structured overview of the important key data or information of the evidences
          contained in a VCD. This overview – the data representation – can be implemented either language
          independent or in multiple languages, so there is no need to translate the evidence any more if it is
          sufficiently described through context specific data. The enhanced and automated documents’
          readability that comes from the context specific data must be compared to the local legal provisions
          and document checking practice adopted by contracting authorities. Whether to use context specific
          data as substitute of a certified translation of an evidences or as decision support belongs to the
          contracting authority’s decision.

          In stage 3, the functionality of the VCD system has to be extended in order to provide a VCD recompilation
          functionality. Re-compiling a VCD package means using evidence data from an existing
          VCD package, validating which of the evidences are outdated, retrieving actual versions of the outdated
          evidences an creating a new VCD package which contains the not-outdated evidences from the
          original VCD package and the newly obtained evidences. The re-compilation process considers only
          those evidences which are necessary in be compliant to the criteria which have to be addressed in the
          new VCD package. The re-compilation can be invoked to re-compile a VCD package for a different

        Stage 3 will include the features depicted in chapter 2.4.3. Providing context specific data leads to an
        additional support for the economic operator and for the contracting authority addressing the need to
        evaluate the contents of evidences across borders. An economic operator is able to verify the
        correctness of the provided context specific data. The contracting authority in turn can check the
        suitability of an Economic Operator by having a sufficient summary of the contents of a VCD in the
        required language. The provision of context specific data avoids the need for translating certain
        evidences that are available in electronic format and allow the description of its contents using the
        common standard schema of context specific data. This approach follows again the idea to ensure the
        completeness of the VCD on the one hand and the level of support on the other hand by stepwise
        including more electronic evidences to the VCD.
        An important point to ensure the acceptance of this approach is to establish or expand the trust in
        national VCD services cross borders:
        <itemize>
          <item>In stage 1 contracting authorities are required to trust the provided evidences, issuing bodies, translators and the correctness of the international mapping</item>
          <item>In stage 2 contracting authorities are required to trust the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing valid (not outdated) evidences or other evidences which are suitable to give evidence for the required criteria</item>
          <item>In stage 3 contracting authorities are required to expand their trust into the national VCD service providers as they are responsible for the compilation of VCD packages containing context specific data which augment the evidence content. On the side of the VCD service providers, composing a VCD package is a more or less complex task depending on national country abilities, willingness, etc.</item>
        </itemize>
        Stage 3 as a concept does not predetermine a solution where all evidences are provided electronically
        in machine interpretable form. Therefore stage 3 is flexible enough to be implemented in countries 
        where issuing bodies provide their evidences either in paper form, as scanned copies, as unstructured
        electronic documents or as fully structured electronic documents.
        One key requirement is the definition of a common schema of context specific data out of given
        evidences through reverse engineering methods and to agree on such a definition. The definition of
        national occurrences of the context specific schema has to be done by each member state on its own.
        One limitation which will be faced in the specification phase of the current project will be that it is
        unlikely, that a common and agreed upon standard schema of context specific data should be
        established across context specific networks (e.g. Business Registers). Thus the long term goal
        should be the development of this unified set of context specific data which is necessary to provide all
        the information a contracting authority wants to get out of evidences. One reasonable way to achieve
        this goal is to put this work on the agenda of context specific networks (e.g. BRITE, ECRIS) and
        standardisation organisations (e.g. CEN). Nevertheless, WP2 would like approve whether it is possible
        to use simplified representations of evidences expressed as context specific data to provide a unified
        representation of major contents. If a specific criminal record for example does not have any entry
        inside it can be represented in context specific format by having a code-list saying “nothing or no
        entry”. Another example could be for example a Balance sheet which can have several different
        values but an easy representation could only be expressed through definition of certain ranges e.g.
        below 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / etc.
        In any case the usage of context specific data cannot prevent and exclude specific needs from
        contracting authorities that may require concurrence of both, the original evidence including certified
        translation and context specific data. The behaviour cannot be influenced since it is dependent on
        national requirements and legislation but the provision of context specific data within the VCD may
        lead to a change of current practices across borders.

        Company Dossier. The key idea of Stage 4 is to create a network for the VCD that allows retrieving
        attestations in a more flexible way. Potentially a direct exchange from trusted attestation services to
        contracting authorities could therefore be implemented. The Virtual Company Dossier than consists of
        some references to attestation services which mandate a contracting authority to obtain information
        directly.
        A direct exchange between trusted attestation services and a contracting authority would provide
        many opportunities with regard to an increase of the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction
        costs of the parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD. Nevertheless such direct
        exchange is very difficult to implement technically because a lot of entities and attestation services
        have to be federated. This raises costs and other technical questions such as access policies to
        trusted attestation services and therewith also legal uncertainties such as data privacy, data security
        and data protection. Also from a political point of view there might be several objections to give a direct
        access to source registers and issuing bodies. Finally a semantic pre-condition would be that evidence
        is provided in a common electronic format that allows an automated transformation into the requestor’s
        target language. Such a solution would then be also depended on mutually recognized, contextspecific
        data formats provided by some specific networks such as BRITE or ECRIS
        (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2008).
        In order to avoid some of the above mentioned complexity we propose some first steps that might help
        to combine the ideas of a VCD and a federated network in medium term allowing further
        improvements of a VCD. To avoid political and technical questions with regard to federated networks,
        the access to attestations services should be done indirectly through the national VCD service
        provider. We suggest that a national VCD service provider uses a temporary storage to hold the
        attestations instead of compiling them directly into a VCD. The VCD then only consists of a number of
        flags that denote an evidence as well as structural data of evidence and context specific data plus a
        reference to retrieve the attestation on demand at the time of awarding. Therefore it would be
        important that the evidence requested is valid at the time of awarding or when the call for tender is
        closed. Also mechanism for maintenance of evidence could potentially be implemented in order to
        keep the information up to date. Such model of indirect exchange would also make it easier for a
        national VCD service to establish an official list of approved economic operators in accordance with
        Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC. The national VCD service provider could use the information
        within its storage to maintain such lists. Evidence that is sufficiently described through context specific
        data could then for example be automatically validated by a national VCD service provider by putting
        validation values into a VCD.
        Stage 4 therewith improves the level of support for the economic operator since the need and burden
        to present specific attestations to the contracting authority will be eliminated. Stage 4 therewith fulfils
        the paradigm shift where a contracting authority only asks for the fulfilment of certain criteria and not
        for the delivery of specific evidence. It changes the general approach of providing attestations at the
        time of the bid but consequently performs all the related functionality of stages 2 and 3 (e.g. provision
        of structural data of evidence and context specific data). Stage 4 introduces the "on-demand" idea
        which allows retrieving evidence directly from the national VCD service provider on individual basis. In
        order to ensure the level of completeness, the VCD network package needs to be extended stepwise
        by including evidences which are sufficiently described through agreed and standardised contextspecific
        data and structural data of evidence (and which can easily be validated by the national VCD
        service provider when he accredits economic operators according to Article 52). We propose the
        following major building blocks to establish a VCD networked package:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            Compilation of evidence within a VCD is based on structural and context specific data. The
            compiled VCD network package only contains both data types and provides references to retrieve
            attestations when necessary (i.e. “on demand”). The VCD contains references in the meaning of
            processing instructions for the contracting authority to retrieve the requested attestations on
            individual basis at the time of awarding. The reference or processing instruction includes a
            mechanism to grant access rights to the contracting authority in order to retrieve these attestations
            within a certain period of time.
          </item>
          <item>
            The national VCD service provider still handles the data retrieval from attestation services and
            holds evidence within a temporary storage. When the National VCD Service Provider receives a
            valid request at the time of awarding from a contracting authority mandated by the economic
            operator he delivers the requested evidence to the contracting authority.
          </item>
          <item>
            Stage 4 will provide a good opportunity to establish an official list of approved economic operators
            in accordance with Article 52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC. Evidences (and in particular those that
            are sufficiently described through context specific data) could be validated by a national VCD
            service provider by putting validation values into a VCD. Mechanisms for maintenance of evidence
            could potentially be implemented in order to keep the information up to date and respectively
            maintain a state of accredited economic operators.
          </item>
        </itemize>
        The difference between Stage 3 and 4 lies in the moment at which specific evidence will be requested
        or delivered. The VCD network package will include all the data that is necessary to qualify an
        economic operator according to the methods, rules and functions described in stages 2-3. The only
        difference is that some of these evidences are not directly included into the VCD but can be retrieved
        through references in order to allow the contracting authority to retrieve the evidence on individual
        basis or “on-demand”. Stage 4 allows further implementations towards federated networks and
        provides opportunities to establish lists of approved economic operators in accordance with Article 52
        (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC11.
        Table 6 provides an overview of the VCD network package outcome, approach, benefits and
        necessary efforts and/or limitations of the proposed concept.

     <title>Use Case description</title>
     <text_body>
      Stage 4 does not contain a modelled use case diagram that clarifies the system interaction and a
      detailed description of requirements because it mainly relies on the functions introduced in the
      previous stages and there are no pilots yet for this stage. Nevertheless the use case description
      provides a short textual explanation and major requirements of this stage are mentioned. Functions in
      round brackets ( ) are new to this use case:
      The economic operator requests a VCD on the basis of stages 1, 2 and 3 at the National Service
      Provider. The National Service Provider starts the VCD creation process by requesting attestations
      from Trusted Attestation Services that are connected to context specific networks. Trusted Attestation
      Services provide requested attestations to a local database or repository that is owned by the National
      VCD Service Provider (store attestation). The VCD system enables the economic operator to mandate
      the contracting authority to access his attestations within the VCD system if the attestations are
      sufficiently described through context specific data (mandate to request attestation through VCD
      specific reference) and the VCD system creates a specific reference into the VCD itself (set reference
      to attestation to VCD).
      When all attestations are compiled by the VCD system the economic operator can submit its VCD to
      the contracting authority. The contracting authority can now request attestations through the reference
      that is specified in the VCD (request attestation on individual basis). The VCD System checks whether
      the contracting authority has sufficient access rights and has been mandated by the economic
      operator to retrieve that attestation (check access rights). Afterwards the VCD system delivers the
      attestation to the contracting authority (retrieve attestation) or informs the economic about a request
      that cannot be handled adequately (conflict resolution). The economic operator than may have to
      provide an additional translation to the contracting authority within a certain period of time.

       Stage 4 relies on several functionalities or concepts that have been already addressed and described
      in previous stages. Basically the VCD network package relies on most of the features and
      functionalities already described in the previous stages. Nevertheless some of them take a particular
      role for implementing stage 4:
      <itemize>
        <item>Stage1: Mapping of evidence through pre-VCD mapping tool.</item>
        <item>Stage2: Compiling a VCD from several different kinds of data.</item>
        <item>Stage2 and 3: Implementation of direct access to issuing bodies and further description of interfaces to provide structural data of evidence and context specific data.</item>
        <item>Stage 2 and 3: The provision of data of evidence and context specific data of electronic attestations in order to approve attestations easily.</item>
        <item>Stage 2 and 3: Agreement on structural data of evidence and context specific data and description of national subsets of it in order to avoid the delivery of translations.</item>
        <item>Stage 3: A semantic standardisation of context specific data that describe the major contents of attestations which have a relatively uniform structure and uniform contents. WP2 should also provide easy solutions for transforming complex information contained in attestations into simple representations. For example a balance sheet could be much more easily represented electronically if a specific tender would only demand to fulfil a certain range of capital (e.g. until 1 Million / from 1 Million to 10 / …) that has to be met by the economic operator.</item>
        <item>Stage 3: Possibilities to update a VCD and therewith enabling the national VCD service provider to take the role of a validation point in order to implement Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC.</item>
      </itemize>
      In addition, Stage 4 will introduce the “on-demand” approach. Providing “on-demand” access to
      evidence requires the necessity to establish a National VCD Service Provider which is electronically
      connected to all attestation providers in the economic operator’s country. In order to avoid the
      necessity to establish a connectivity matrix from all contracting authorities to all attestation providers,
      the national VCD service provider has to act as a proxy. Depending on the implementation
      mechanism, the retrieval of “on-demand” data can either be realized:
      <itemize>
        <item>By enacting highly available, high performing online interfaces from the proxy to all attestation providers in the economic operator’s country. This first approach is extremely ambitious but the only way to always access actualised data.</item>
        <item>By caching the attestations at the proxy. This second approach could be implemented with lower efforts but leads to the situation that the data provided by the VCD package is in the end as actual as the data provided by a VCD package that is compiled using the concept from stage 3.</item>
      </itemize>
      The relations between entities shown in the figure above imply to set up and share common access
      policies. They will be based upon technical, functional and organisational commitments related to
      authentication, mutual recognition, granting actors access rights, traceability and auditability of
      information and trust mechanism.
      On this basis updating functionalities and access mechanisms can be easily implemented. They could
      be performed within a “Pull model” between contracting authorities and national service provider as
      well as between national service providers and attestation providers. The definition of pull models
      between those entities would allow several opportunities and flexibilities for example to update expired
      evidence or to request evidence on individual basis.
      In a “perfect world” a contracting authority could directly access to the latest attestation, but this is
      difficult to implement because a lot of entities and attestation providers have to be federated. To avoid
      this and several political as well data protection and privacy issues, the access to attestations should
      be done through a temporary storage hosted by the National Service Provider. We assume that the
      attestation must be valid when the call for tender is closed instead of pre-serving permanent validity of
      attestations at the temporary storage of the national VCD service provider.
      An organisational solution is necessary to solve conflicts that may appear when a contracting authority
      requesting attestations on individual basis and does not believe on the validation value given by the
      VCD. This could potentially include conflict resolution in cases of errors or when an economic operator
      has to produce a translation of the attestation in a certain period of time and to send it to the
      contracting authority via the national VCD service provider.
      Thinking about the future, we can imagine a scenario assisting the contracting authorities in lowering
      burden of validating attestations and lowering the burden for economic operators to provide
      attestations. A real added value in eTendering processes would be to reach a state where contracting
      authorities could only focus on the offer and where the main purpose of a VCD networked package is
      in trusting in its status ensured by a National VCD Service Provider.
      Stage 4 will provide a good opportunity to implement Article 52 of directive 2004/18/EC. Article 52
      provides guidance in making proof of exclusion and selection criteria much easier for the contracting
      authority. The interaction between the economic operator and the contracting authority can then be
      summarized by “trust in my National VCD Service Provider who holds the attestations for me”.
      Obviously, there are several difficulties for such a model that include political considerations,
      auditability, traceability, liability, mutual recognition of procedures with regard to Article 52, trust
      between national VCD service providers etc. All those circumstances have to be solved before
      implementing a VCD networked package on the basis of Article 52. Nevertheless stage 4 provides
      guidance in how to connect both ideas in an easy way.

  <title>Legal, organisational and semantic framework and requirements</title>
  <text_body>
    Interoperability is a major topic being discussed in eGovernment for a while now. Already in 2003, the
    EC has published a working document, the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), where the
    authors defined IOP as “the means by which the interlinking of systems, information and ways of
    working, whether within or between administrations, nationally or across Europe, or with the enterprise
    sector, occurs” ((IDABC 2004), pp. 6). The document recalls IOP needs on technical, semantic and
    organizational layer with a rather wide understanding of IOP (IDABC 2004). In late 2008 a draft for a
    revised European Interoperability Framework was published by IDABC extending the requirement for
    IOP to five levels12:
    The aim of this chapter is to draw a picture about the current situation applied in the countries with
    regard to potentially placement of a VCD in the MS according to the European Interoperability
    Framework version 2 (EIF2):
    <itemize>
      <item>The legal framework thereby refers to appropriate synchronization of the legislation in the cooperating MS so that electronic data originating in any given MS is accorded to proper legal weight and recognition wherever it needs to be used in other MS. This includes rules with regard to tendering, submission and awarding including certificates and attestations that are typically required and their mapping to evidences and exclusion and selection criteria from a legal point of view.</item>
      <item>The organizational framework then refers to the processes by which different organizations such as different public administrations collaborate to achieve their mutually agreed eGovernment service-related goals. This includes best practices for tendering, submission and awarding derived from activities such as stakeholder analysis and stakeholder questionnaires that have been developed.</item>
      <item>The semantic framework ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information (concepts, organization, services, etc) is preserved and well understood. It includes data aspects of the target solution with regard to common understanding, agreement procedure on shared definition of terms and mapping of evidence.</item>
      <item>The technical framework refers to technical issues involved in linking computer systems and services (interfaces, interconnection services, middleware, data exchange, accessibility, security services, and validation service…). It specifically includes aspects with regard to the PEPPOL infrastructure for submitting a VCD across borders.</item>
    </itemize>
    Each chapter results in a framework for the application of a VCD, which is described through a set of
    requirements that haven been derived from the activities mentioned before.

      <title>Overview about organisational framework</title>
      <text_body>
        The organisational framework for the VCD has several dimensions. The use cases of the stages
        above show the actors that are involved and have to be addressed through the organisational
        framework e.g. economic operators, contracting authorities, issuing bodies, national service providers
        etc. Within the project it will be necessary to manage these different kinds of stakeholders by
        adequately integrating them into the project. Thereby it will be of importance to define their specific
        role and their importance for our work package within the lifetime of the project. Networks of gathering
        evidences are complex to handle because there are several stakeholders to consider. To avoid
        problems of involvement a clear approach of stakeholder analysis is needed. WP2 can only provide
        guidance to this since it will be a national responsibility. Austria for example has set up a physical
        stakeholder forum that informs key stakeholder in regular time intervals about the results of PEPPOL.
        Next to this the WP2 team of Austria is building up a participation platform13 where latest results are
        presented and can be further discussed within forums and mini surveys. Each member state has to
        define its own strategy to involve stakeholders during the lifetime of the project. WP2 has developed a
        template for stakeholder management that may provide guidance for this. It can be found in ANNEX
        IV: Template for stakeholder analysis.
        To ensure a wide acceptance of the solutions provided by WP2 among stakeholders we have to
        prevent changes in national procedures and infrastructures but to utilize them as much as possible. In
        stages 2, 3 and 4 it will be necessary to establish a national service provider who will take care about
        critical VCD processes and therewith ensure legitimacy, trust and appropriate change management.
        Any VCD solution should provide universal support for economic operators of any size. Testing of a
        VCD solution will be very important and should be done by reprocessing historical tenders in order to
        avoid problems of disqualification due to errors of applications.
        Another important part of the stakeholder analysis is the identification of recognized public and private
        issuing bodies. This may be done through the support of DG Markt’s study (Siemens_and_Time.lex
        2007) report on national country profiles14 and additional national analysis. These entities then need to
        be included into a list of recognized private and public issuing bodies which will be an important part
        when defining structural data of evidence (e.g. issuer, availability, delivery time etc). A national VCD
        application may list several different issuing bodies that provide the same attestation. These may have
        different characteristics as for example price, availability or delivery time. However the choice which
        attestation is most appropriate should be left to the economic operator but this decision may be
        supported through displaying these different characteristics. If an economic operator for example
        decides to rely on a manual issuing service that cannot be directly invoked by a national service
        provider it is the responsibility of the economic operator to provide this attestation and act as issuing
        body by uploading it to the system of the national service provider in order to create a VCD package.
        Each national service provider provides a national VCD solution in accordance to the key principles
        mentioned in the use cases. National solutions therefore may vary due to freedom of implementing
        national solutions but conformance to key issues should ensure their interoperability. A key issue for
        example is the pre-VCD mapping tool and it should be integrated into any national solutions either as
        a module or as interface to query results for the mapping of evidences among member states. To
        enable automated information processing on the basis of the pre-VCD mapping tool within national
        solutions additional structured information has to be defined within the Call for Tender that enables the
        retrieval of qualification and selection criteria from contracting authorities. A contracting authority
        therefore has to specify a relevant criteria subset within a Call for Tender which can then for example
        be referred to by an economic operator by providing the ID of a Call for Tender to the national solution.
        Two phased tendering is not explicitly foreseen by the VCD even if it might be used for this purpose. In
        most cases we do not see great efforts for economic operators in two-phased since many countries
        only required the submission of self-declarations.
        None of the above mentioned solutions explicitly requires implementing Article 52 of directive
        2004/18/EC. Thus the VCD itself provides support for the proofing of conformance but it does not
        provide any information whether an economic operator is conform. In stages 3 and 4 a higher “level of
        decision making” is promoted and we see especially the provision of context specific data (stage 3)
        and the on demand approach (stage 4) as a pre-conditions that ease the establishment of lists of
        approved economic operators across borders. However if there is a country that wishes to enable
        such a proof in the VCD it can be done before but will require several manual efforts. Although such
        proof of conformance should rely on Articles 45 and 46 of directive 2004/18/EC first.

          Pilots implemented in stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 produce VCD artefacts that enable matching between
          attestations and certain criteria across borders and the implementation of the VCD package. This does
          not include that any check or proof of conformance is performed by any national service provider who
          provides a VCD package with regard to the contents of the package and its attestation as for example
          describe in Article 52 of the directive (“official lists of approved contractors, suppliers or service
          providers”). In stages 1, 2, 3 and potentially also in stage 4 the check and proof of conformance
          belongs to the economic operator himself. Nevertheless any stage may be implemented according to
          Article 52 if there is adequate legal basis within a country and if there is political commitment for doing

      <title>Overview of semantic framework</title>
      <text_body>
        Today’s work in public administration is still strongly based on the work with documents and files. With
        the consideration of data object and document flow, a disambiguation of the terms used is reasonable
        to clarify the concepts.
        Electronic documents can be text, tables, images or a combination of these and are available in digital
        form. Generally, this comprises each potentially permanent recording of data on a data carrier. Many
        European states allow the use of electronic documents as a replacement for documents in written
        form. Such documents find also application in tendering procedures and shall be part of VCD. Thus
        the electronic document is the central means for Public eProcurement and for the usage of a VCD on
        pan-European level.
        The characteristics of a document are combined from physical shape (paper or electronic file), formal
        properties (e.g. structure and style), organisational properties (functional relation, version, indexing in
        a filing plan), content, document type (storage obligations, legal character, editability), time stamping
        (creation, expiry, last access), editors (sender, creator, author) and users (receiver, (last) editor,
        reader).
        Official documents need to fulfil specific requirements like completeness, integrity and transparency.
        Apart from this, they also need to conform to the legality principle of administrative actions and to audit
        trails. A file (record) is a factual and task-related arrangement and collection of documents which
        belong together. The goal is to keep the content available and traceable at any time. Files are
        recorded with a unique identification.
        This chapter describes the semantic framework of work package 2 that comprise solutions for the VCD
        from the data perspective. Section 3.2.2 therefore provides a brief overview about general patterns for
        data representation and utilisation. Thereby different data perspectives have to be separated that
        comprise a VCD:
        <itemize>
          <item>Structural data of VCD-Package: Data that describe a VCD package</item>
          <item>Economic operator data: Data that describe an economic operator</item>
          <item>Tender specific data: Data that describe a specific Call for Tender</item>
          <item>Structural data of evidence: Data that describe the structure of an attestation</item>
          <item>Context specific data: Data that describe the content of an evidence.</item>
          <item>Validation data: Data that describe the validation of a certain criteria.</item>
          <item>Evidences: Attestations and candidate statements</item>
          <item>Translations: Translation of attestations</item>
        </itemize>
        In order to provide solutions for these different perspectives each one needs to be analysed and
        further defined. Important information for defining those types of data can be derived from already
        existing studies, reports and literature. A VCD than will have to consider several standards and
        methodologies that relate to record management and metadata development. Beside we will build
        upon the results provided by CEN/BII. Relevant standards and methodologies are mentioned in
        section 3.2.3.
        Section 3.2.4 then provides a list of requirements that are important for the VCD and its pre-VCD
        mapping tool. This includes for example the level of completeness of a VCD and a pre-VCD mapping
        tool, principles for including attestations, the use of placeholders for evidences that cannot be further
        classified, the specification of semantics and the visualization of a VCD package.

    <p id="3.2.2">
      <title>Patterns for Data Representation and Utilisation</title>
      <text_body>
        The Vision of the VCD comprises several different concepts such as visualization of data (e.g. stage2:
        visualisation of a VCD), sending / receiving data elements (e.g. stage 2: collecting evidence or stage
        4: requesting attestation on demand), transferring data (e.g. stage 2: submission of a VCD) and
        routing of data (stage 4: exchange of validation values). To further clarify their interrelation we take the
        research by (Russel N., Hofsteded A.H.M. et al. 2005) of data occurrences in systems into account
        that characterize following categories:
        <itemize>
          <item>Data visibility</item>
          <item>Data interaction</item>
          <item>Data transfer</item>
          <item>Data based routing</item>
        </itemize>
        Data visibility refers to the context in which data can be defined and utilised. The binding to specific
        constructs directly influences the way in which data may be used (e.g. intermediate results at task
        level or global data storage during execution of a specific case). Crossing the borders of one system
        and organisation, means have to be available to ensure the needed visibility.
        Data interaction patterns investigate on the different passing of data between components. Most data
        interaction appears on two forms (see Table 8 for more details):
        <itemize>
          <item>One component sends data unscheduled to another one (Push)</item>
          <item>One component receives data unscheduled (Pull)</item>
        </itemize>
        Data transfer adds the view on how to pass data between components to the dimension of data
        interaction. The way of communicating data depends on given access rights, a shared common data
        space, on the kind and type of data and the design of the workflow, which takes the before mentioned
        factors into account. A more detailed view on cross-organisational data transfer is given in Table 9.
        Data based routing considers the influence of data in the workflow on the control-flow. Descriptions
        include control-flow decisions on existence, appearance or the value of data. This set of patterns is the
        cross-link of data patterns and control-flow patterns. Though it is question of data visibility and data
        interaction if data-based routing is applicable in respect to interoperability.

        <text_body>
          A selection of such documents will be included in any VCD; they will be produced by national units
          according to national legislation. This means that their content of data and information will vary. Both
          manual and automated cross border evaluation processes will require information about the legal
          validity of the documents, record by record.
          This means that the records of these documents need to be tagged for the processing. The label can
          give access to contextual information, like a country’s legislation and constraints valid for the very
          document.
          Methods are specified in ISO 15489-117 “Records Management”, and European requirements are
          detailed in MOREQ II18. Application of the standard will ease manual processing of such documents

          CEN BII is addressing the convergence between UN/CEFACT and UBL by working out neutral
          descriptions called profiles that are describing business operational units of business functionality, like
          the VCD. The CEN BII VCD profile will be a document that can be interpreted and used by systems
          based on both UN/CEFACT and on UBL. The process of a cross-border submission of the VCD will be
          done co-jointly with the CEN BII workshop. Hence, the use of ISO 15489 and ISO 11179 leads to
          standardised records and information management that can be automated in existing structures.

          <itemize>
            <item>Evidence of a company’s identity (Extracts of commercial records or equivalent documents)</item>
            <item>Evidence of compliance with fiscal obligations (Declarations from fiscal services or equivalent documents)</item>

          Both record by record according to the said standard; the goal is to obtain agreed descriptions that are
          applicable in participating states. The descriptions will be valid in all the defined stages, and it will
          prepare for fully automated processing.
          The processing of records, information and data requires standardised metadata; the metadata
          themselves need to be agreed between existing and potential users. The methodology of ISO 11179
          will be used for specifications that can be used to detail the profiles developed by CEN BII WG 1.
          This means that the VCD can be developed from a collection of paper documents to a file that can be
          processed according to agreed CEN BII profiles by the use of the two standards. The CEN BII
          description of a VCD will be neutral when it comes to semantics, and it will be helpful for systems
          based on both UBL and UN/CEFACT; applications can accordingly be set up by use of any of them.

        <text_body>
          Description
          Semantic interoperability refers to the exchange of information in an understandable way within and
          across organizational borders.
          “To run real electronic business transactions without human intervention, semantic interoperability
          must be achieved. Deliverables from CEN BII are addressing semantic interoperability for some
          business documents relevant in electronic procurement. Outcomes from CEN BII are syntax neutral,
          which means that different syntaxes can be bound to the semantic requirements for the documents to
          be exchanged meaningfully despite their syntax.
          Even if syntax interoperability is not achieved in a pan-European framework, it has to be possible to
          transform from a syntax vocabulary to another one without loosing.
          Semantic interoperability should apply to all documents related with electronic procurement. It is
          required to work on the semantic interoperability for electronic attestations and certificates that
          requires not only semantic alignment but legal alignment in Europe.”(Bausa O. and Boujraf A. 2009)

          Description
          A VCD package will show its full potential only when all requested evidences (all that are necessary to
          prove all the requested criteria) are contained within it. The range of attestations varies from selfdeclarations
          to official attestations/certificates issued by public authorities. From a very pragmatic point
          of view it seems reasonable to focus on a subset of attestations in a first step and to complete the
          VCD Package later on. It is also reasonably to define, where and when permitted, a default packaging
          list of tender independent criteria to be served without the burden of reading or interpreting the “Call
          for Tender”. Several requirements can be derived.
          Requirement
          When implementing any tool, system or service WP2 MUST focus on mandatory requirements and
          evidences mentioned in Articles 45 and 46 first since theses Articles are not tender-specific and
          therewith relevant for nearly all tenders.
          Measurement

          The definition, specification, modelling or implementation of the pre-VCD mapping tool will focus on
          Articles 45 to 46
          Requirement
          Articles 47 to 50 open a wide range of different criteria which are tender- and country-specific thus
          they MUST be added stepwise to the pre-VCD mapping tool (which may require a higher-level

        <title>Principle for including attestations in stage 3 and 4</title>
        <text_body>
          Description
          Stage 4 implies the exchange of certified validation values (e.g. certified “Yes/No” statements) instead
          of delivering an attestation. The attestations can be requested by the contracting authority on
          individual basis at the time of awarding and selection of candidates.
          Validation values (e.g. certified “Yes/No” statements) should only be applied to networks where
          sufficient context specific data is available in order to approve this value. The validation value should
          be able to prove conformance to criteria of qualitative exclusion and selection unambiguously. This
          principle should be applied wherever possible for example:
          • The economic operator has to prove that he paid fiscal taxes according to national regulations – in
          this case a “Yes/No statement” will be sufficient.
          • The economic operator has to provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order to proof its
          economic or financial standing – in this case the whole attestation (balance sheet or extracts of it)
          has to be delivered.
          - If sufficient context specific data format for representing those information unambiguously is
          available it may be applied for stage 4.
          Requirement
          PEPPOL WP2 is not focussing on the creation of context-specific data of attestations or candidate
          statements in multilingual versions. If context-specific data is provided in multilingual versions (e.g.
          XBRL, ECRIS etc.) this has a high priority to be included into stage 3 and stage 4.
          Requirement
          If attestations are described sufficiently in multiple lingual versions they SHOULD be included first to
          stages 3 and 4.
          Requirement
          If the prove concentrates on qualitative aspects (e.g. provide balance sheet or extracts from it in order
          to proof its economic or financial standing) then the validation value cannot be applied. Instead such
          an attestation can be included into VCD stages 3 and 4 if it is sufficiently described through context

      <title>Overview of legal framework</title>
      <text_body>
        Public procurement requires strict compliance with the legal frameworks provided by the procurement
        directives. Supporting pan-European procurement and implementing services to enable pan-European
        deployment of evidences is the major goal of PEPPOL WP2. Any WP2 solution therefore needs to
        comply with the legal requirements concerning selection and exclusion criteria in public procurement
        defined by the European procurement directives and in national implementing legislation.
        Compliance with these regulations will ensure acceptance of a solution and will ensure and help to
        establish a "level of trust" between the parties involved. Therefore a comprehensive analysis of the
        relevant legal regulation has to take place. To get an overview on the legal requirements and
        regulations on different levels the following sources have to be analysed:
        <itemize>
          <item>European level (e.g. directive 2004/18/EG)</item>
          <item>National level (e.g. national procurement acts, other related regulations)</item>
        </itemize>
        The recommended process to extract the legal requirements of a VCD service or VCD service
        provider follows the maturity path, defined within WP 2, starting with the "Status quo" and ending up
        with "Stage 4". At each level limitations and requirements have been identified with respect to legal
        requirements.
        Any technical VCD solution requires legal interoperability in order to being used without doubts. Legal
        interoperability of a VCD requires the comparison of legal conditions within the Member States.
        National procurement legislation implements the directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC but vary due
        to different national conditions and practices. In cross-border procurement the national law often has
        to be enriched through principles mentioned in the relevant directives. When developing a solution the
        differences between national procurement acts and the European Directive has to be taken into
        account in order to define a solution that is conform to national law and can be applied on a pan-
        European level.
        The comparison of legal aspects has been done by comparing the national legislation on eTendering
        with respect to the European legislation. A set of 40 legal questions has been developed in order to
        describe the national legal environment with regard to the relevant Articles of the above mentioned
        directive and to draw conclusions from it. Those legal questions often target critical aspects for a
        potential VCD solution as for example the role and use of self declarations as replacement for
        documents that can not be issued within one Member State.
        The legal analysis provides guidance in analysing the national legal frameworks and their principles
        with regard to cross-border tendering, submission of evidence and the awarding of contracts within
        Member States. The legal analysis thereby discusses in particular the following topics:
        <itemize>
          <item>Proof of suitability and exclusion criteria</item>
          <item>Types, formality and processing of evidence</item>
          <item>Implications of different procedures, services, thresholds and bidding syndicates</item>
          <item>Other issues like data protection and storage, use of signatures, liability</item>

          compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment and which
          guarantee that tenders are assessed in conditions of effective competition. The VCD package should
          ensure equal treatment of foreign economic operators by providing a tool to submit evidence from one
          member state to another. Therefore Article 52(5) states that “economic operators from other Member
          States may not be obliged to undergo such registration or certification in order to participate in a public
          contract. The contracting authorities shall recognise equivalent certificates from bodies established in

          A contracting authority sends a contract notice to a Publication body that publishes the call. The Call
          for Tender should contain the definition of specific criteria on qualitative selection and exclusion that
          are relevant to this particular procurement.
          If an economic operator decides to participate in a particular procurement procedure he can directly
          retrieve the relevant criteria by using the information published in the contract notice. In cases below
          threshold the economic operator might send a direct request to the procurer in order to retrieve the
          required information. The economic operator will be enabled to get a mapping to the relevant national
          attestations via the pre-VCD mapping tool. (cf. subsection 3.1.2.8: “Specification of criteria subset by
          the Procurer”; and subsection 3.1.2.9: “Provision of criteria subset by the Economic Operator”
          Requirement
          The contracting authority SHOULD specify a subset of evidences from the superset evidences that are
          relevant to a specific Call for Tender.

        <title>Scope of mutual recognition</title>
        <text_body>
          Description
          Description
          Article 52(5) states “that contracting authorities shall recognise equivalent certificates from bodies
          established in other Member States. They shall also accept other equivalent means of proof” (EC
          30.04.2004). This specifically points to the relevant Community rules on mutual recognition of
          diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications. The scope of mutual recognition needs
          to be clearly defined by legal experts. This requirement in particular targets the following topics
          <itemize>
            <item>
              Does the scope of mutual recognition include the acceptance of foreign procedures of providing
              evidence with regards to Article 52 (1) (e.g. national service provider proofs conformance of
              attestation with given criteria and confirms this proof by including validation values into the VCD)
              or only the acceptance of foreign documents?
              <itemize>
                <item>Which role trusted third parties (TTP) must take in this respect (e.g. national service provider)?</item>
                <item>Which role takes liability in this respect?</item>
              </itemize>
            </item>
            <item>
              In most Member States conventional scanned copies are accepted as proof. Does mutual
              recognition requires acceptance of scanned copies? Does mutual recognition provide support to
              submit scanned copies to other Member States which require official scans that are produces by
              dedicated public authority?
            </item>
          </itemize>
          Requirement
          The scope of mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to acceptance of foreign
          procedures and the role and liability of trusted third parties.
          Requirement
          The scope of mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to the provision of official

            Not every Member State provides all attestations that are necessary for an economic operator to prove
            conformance with given criteria specified by another Member State. Thus only the economic operators
            from Member States where such attestations are available can provide these attestations. Other
            economic operators have to provide similar evidence instead (e.g. a candidate statement). The
            working group has to provide a concept of how each possible attestation has to be fulfilled (mapping of
            evidences defined in the directive with national implementation). Thereby the evidences provided by
            economic operator should be considered of equal value as evidences provided by a traditional issuing
            body if equivalence is missing

          Description
          In case a MS decides to exchange validation values (e.g. certified “Yes/No” statements) instead of
          delivering an attestation physically (stage 4 specific) it MUST ensure that this provision is legally
          allowed. Directive 2004/17/EC and Article 52 of Directive 2004/18/EC may provide a legal basis for
          such decision. The legal foundation in the country will provide a basis to accept these statements
          across borders according to the principle of mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates or other
          evidence of formal qualifications. The requirement is strongly related to the organisational
          requirement: “Scope with regard to Article 52”.

    <title>Technical Framework (Infrastructure specific)</title>
    <p id="3.4.1">
      <title>Overview of technical framework</title>
      <text_body>
        This chapter shall include technical requirements that are essential for submitting a VCD via the
        PEPPOL infrastructures. In particular this refers to the proposed infrastructure of WP8 and the
        interrelation with our work package. The PEPPOL infrastructure of WP8 is dedicated in particular to
        the exchange of electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner. Thereby it connects
        to existing e-business frameworks and value added networks and is being built on existing
        technologies and standards that have been tested and which have proven to be reliable and secure
        for enterprise use. WP2 takes a specific role within the project by concentrating on pre-awarding
        issues where requirements and procedures are often stricter due to principle like equal treatment, nondiscrimination,
        transparency, competition etc. Although a VCD does not include the offer itself it
        provides several documents that are of great importance for the award of contracts and therewith
        critical for the success of an economic operator for example in cases of disqualification because of late
        delivery of a VCD.
        An overall pre-condition for using the infrastructure and WP2 solutions in long term is that they are
        governed even after the project lifetime by maintaining and sustaining its functions. Therefore the
        governing models of WP8 and WP2 should be aligned.
        Authentication is an essential feature of WP2 as a Virtual Company Dossier contains several
        documents that contain sensitive data about an economic operator. Hence, it has to be ensured that
        only those persons that have sufficient rights are able to access and retrieve these data.
        Authentication of origin is also an important feature with regard to non-repudiation, for example when
        submitting a VCD to a contracting authority.
        Authentication is a verification of evidence of identity; for individuals and companies identifiers are
        used to process authentication. Such identifiers are national and in many countries specific and
        maintained within sectors, like tax, health, health insurance, employment, registration authorities, etc.
        PEPPOL will need to design an authentication system that serves its purposes. Hence, collaboration
        with WP 1 will be strengthened in the second phase of WP 2.
        Time-stamping shall ensure that the submission of a VCD is adequately documented for example to
        verify that it has been sent or received previously to the closure of a call for tender. In order to obtain
        trust, the VCD services should use certified time stamps.
        Moreover there are several actors involved in the WP2 scenarios which need to be connected to the
        PEPPOL infrastructure thus a sufficient allocation of identifiers, in connection with the identity an actor
        claims to have, has to be ensured. This shall ensure that unauthorized usage of an individuals’ identity
        is avoided. Overall we see a need for commonly monitored identity and access management in
        particular for all national VCD solutions and for the PEPPOL infrastructure thus both approaches
        should be aligned and should make use of the same mechanisms through for example single-sign-on
        functionality.
        Apart from functionalities like addressability and discovery, the infrastructure should provide access
        points to support the actors or services to connect to the infrastructure. The PEPPOL infrastructure will
        make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a secure and reliable manner. Thus
        also the VCD should be able to be submitted through the PEPPOL infrastructure. We also assume
        that a VCD in stages 2 and 3 can be potentially submitted through other means but this is up to the
        choice of an economic operator and should not be promoted because bypassing the infrastructure is
        critical from the viewpoint of using validation services to ensure confidentiality of a VCD and its
        contained documents (WP1) and secure and reliable transport ensured through the PEPPOL
        infrastructure (WP8). During transportation the integrity of a VCD has to be ensured when for example
        validating it.
        Usage of the Infrastructure will require that national access points to the infrastructure (e.g. national
        service providers, contracting authorities) will be implemented but also direct access points that
        support SMEs in connecting to it. We also see a potential need to access web services via the
        infrastructure that enable client-side code generation in SOAP frameworks for example for the retrieval
        of attestations on demand, connecting to tendering platforms or viewing the VCD on some platform at
        the national service provider.

          The PEPPOL infrastructure will make it possible to exchange electronic business documents in a
          secure and reliable manner. It connects existing frameworks and networks, but also allows small
          businesses to participate in the electronic business processes if they have Internet access and can be
          securely identified. The PEPPOL infrastructure is being built on existing technologies and standards
          that have been tested and which have proven to be reliable and secure to use. For WP2 it will
          important to access the infrastructure from different perspectives. An economic operator for example
          has to submit a VCD via the PEPPOL infrastructure. A contracting authority may require access to a
          database hosted by a national service provider to receive an attestation by using a direct reference to
          it. Some web services may be connected to the infrastructure to add additional functionalities to a VCD
          or for example to receive mapping information from the pre-VCD mapping tool. Therefore different
          access points to the PEPPOL infrastructure may be necessary in particular:

        been Stage 1, the pre-VCD mapping tool, will be built upon this information by providing automated
        mappings and comparisons between the defined documents via the mentioned exclusion criteria (cf.
        Table 10).
        Combining structural information about evidence and the criteria mentioned in the “Eligibility of
        Tenderes” they are referring to, it will be firstly possible to set up a database with common definitions
        that referring to evidences and secondly to define precise mapping between those evidences via the
        templates. Every partner of this work package should therefore fill the pre-VCD mapping tool with
        national instances and define the mapping to European criteria. This will also enable VCDs of the
        piloting country to work on a wider scope. Even if a country hasn’t defined a pilot implementation for a
        VCD it can receive and interpret a VCD according to the information provided by the pre-VCD

        <title>Relevant technologies and standards for pre-VCD mapping tool</title>
        <text_body>
          This section provides an overview about relevant technologies that can be applied for a pre-VCD
          mapping tool. The pre-VCD mapping tool is depending upon formal semantics that describe how
          evidences related to each other. Therefore WP 2 proposes to derive criteria from the European
          directive 2004/18/EC as shown for instance within the “Eligibility of Tenderers”. Using formal
          semantics with the proposed technologies as presented in section 4.1.3 below enables several
          advantages (Fensel, Lausen et al. 2007):
          <itemize>
            <item>Enable mapping: This involves the creation of certain rules and axioms that define how terms or evidences within one Member State map to terms and evidences within another Member State</item>
            <item>Enable alignment: Refers to the commitment that has to be made in order to determine correspondences between concepts. Alignment is used to find classes of data that are semantically equivalent, but indeed not necessarily logically identical (e.g. Extracts of judicial records or equivalent documents).</item>
            <item>Enable translation: Refers to syntactic rewriting and semantic rewriting to support the translation between two different representations of data.</item>
            <item>Enable merging: Describes the creations of a common model that is used instead of the national models. Merging different national models into a unified one is an approach for semantic integration which is particularly used when national models overlap significantly over a common domain.</item>
          </itemize>
          The usage of formal semantics is an extension which allows annotating syntactical contents in a
          format that is machine-understandable. Formal semantics enables users to share and integrate
          information easily by using descriptive technologies like the Resource Description Framework (RDF),
          the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the data-centric Extensible Markup Language (XML). These
          languages provide a foundation for semantic interoperability. They are combined to give a well-defined
          meaning to the information and data exchanged in order to provide machine-readable descriptions
          and to enable machine-to-machine communication. The semantic theory derives information from data
          through the interpretation of symbols and allows formalizing the meaning of symbols by connecting the
          relevant terms in logical means. The semantic theory therewith provides mechanisms to enable
          semantic interoperability between heterogeneous systems. The key technologies for enabling
          semantic interoperability are shown by the semantic web layer cake in Figure 20 (Shadbolt, Hall et al.
          2006).
          Each layer is based and depends on the layer below, but lower layers do not depend on higher layers.
          The layers can be developed relatively independently. Each layer has a greater level of specialization
          and tends to be more complex than the layers below it. Most of the technologies that are shown in the
          diagram are W3C developed or endorsed. Thus there are potential alternatives for some of the layers
          (Passin 2004), (Shadbolt, Hall et al. 2006), (Fensel 2001):
          <itemize>
            <item>For enabling machines to process data directly, database objects have to be mapped into a system of URIs. URIs using a global naming convention to identify resources thus they are central for semantic interoperability. Resources are associated with a URI so that anyone can link / refer to it and may access an appropriate representation of it.</item>
            <item>XML provides a standard serial syntax for exchanging data and it is becoming the standard for data interchange on the web. However, XML and its schema languages do not express the meaning of the content but rather structure, e.g. nesting information. XML documents are usually based on different schemas but they may represent data with similar semantics.</item>
            <item>RDF is a general method for modelling metadata, through a variety of syntax formats. RDF provides a standard form for representing semantics of data which can be processed by machines. The RDF metadata model allows to define statements about resources by using so called triple stores (subject-predicate-object expressions). Resources in RDF are connected to specific URIs that allow to derive information about the resource and its meaning. RDF is an application of XML thus it provides an XML-based syntax for recording and exchanging RDF information.</item>
            <item>OWL is designed to enable applications to process the content of information instead of just presenting information to humans. OWL facilitates greater expressivity and machine interpretability of content than that supported by XML and RDF by providing additional vocabulary (e.g. relationships between entities) along with a formal semantics. The main idea of OWL is to support an efficient representation of ontologies as well as the support of decision procedures. OWL allows to refer to terms in other ontologies and it uses the linking provided by RDF to enable the distribution of ontologies among different systems</item>
            <item>Logical reasoning is needed to ensure the consistency and correctness of data sets. It is used to infer conclusions that are not explicitly stated but are consistent with and required by a known set of data. Proofs are needed in order to trace the steps of logical reasoning22.</item>
            <item>Trust aims at the provision of authentication mechanisms and the evidence of the trustworthiness of data, services, and agents.</item>
          </itemize>
          RDF is the basic layer for data representation because it is designed to allow data from different
          sources to be written in the same form and therefore distributed between different systems. RDF is
          based on existing standards such as XML and URI. On top of RDF, the ontology layer is being
          developed under use of OWL or any other ontological language. The layers above RDF are the
          subject to many prototype systems that are built to enable a higher degree of semantic interoperability
          between heterogeneous systems.
          Depending on further detailed specification of the pre-VCD mapping, WP 2 partners will make a
          decision to use either a simplified ontology mapping based on XML or to embark on more powerful
          technologies such as RDF or OWL in order to ensure wider interoperability and provide mapping and
          translation features as indicated above.

        <item>on the other hand, the VCD Service Provider in a respective country, who communicates with the European Service Provider for the mapping, and who implements the compilation of a VCD for the economic operator in his/her country (supporting stages 2 – 4 of the VCD concept introduced).</item>
      </itemize>
      The European Service Provider and the VCD Service Provider serve cross-border submission of
      evidences via the VCD packages (simple / advanced / network). Hence, these implementations are
      part of PEPPOL WP 2 pilot implementations. In the initial Description of Work, Austria and Italy have
      planned pilot implementations of stages 2+ (see subsequent sections 4.3 and 4.4 for more detailed
      descriptions of the Austrian and Italian pilot implementations). Through an enlargement of PEPPOL,
      further pilot implementations are aimed at, including:
      <itemize>
        <item>France and Norway intend to implement stage 4;</item>
        <item>Belgium, Czech Republic and Greece aim to implement VCD packages of stages 2-3;</item>
        <item>Sweden intends to implement stage 1.</item>
      </itemize>
      Besides these pilot implementations in the context of WP 2, the WP 2 project partners also aim at
      collaborating intensely with potential activities of the EC (DG MARKT) to implement the pre-VCD
      mapping tool.
      With a total of eight pilot implementations plus the European Service Provider implementation of the
      pre-VCD mapping tool, the WP 2 will reach a wide geographical spread as well as a profound proof of
      the overall VCD concept.
      Since the VCD implementation also touches national demands for existing infrastructures to access
      and retrieve evidences from issuing bodies (see the lower part of Country A in Figure 21), such
      infrastructures and required identity and access management for accessing local issuing bodies are
      considered as parts of national infrastructures where PEPPOL will embark on. Hence, individual
      Member State countries will already have such infrastructures and access mechanisms in place or will
      have to implement them within national scope. The PEPPOL pilot implementations will give indications
      of technical implementations at national level and how the PEPPOL pan-European VCD systems may
      interact and be interconnected with national and/or regional systems of issuing bodies for further
      rollout of the VCD concept in Europe.

      <title>Implementation approach</title>
      <text_body>
        Austria will implement and pilot a VCD service based on the VCD concept introduced in this report.
        The intention is to create a system, which can handle all functions of a stage 3 VCD advanced
        package solution, and thereby achieve:
        <itemize>
          <item>full pan-European interoperability,</item>
          <item>flexibility to meet the dynamics of the organisational and legal changes and</item>
        </itemize>
        The Austrian VCD system will give a living proof of concept of complex pan-European constellations,
        where interoperability is a key success factor for the whole VCD concept.
        Figure 22 demonstrates the scenario for an example of a complex pan-European tendering process
        with stakeholders of different nationalities to be handled by the VCD solution: a consortium of
        economic operators (either equal bidding partners from AT and IT, or Austrian main bidder with Italian
        subcontractor) responds to a tender of a Norwegian contracting authority.
        In order to understand, which qualification, selection and non-exclusion criteria have to be evidenced,
        the Austrian Tender Structure Element 1 (TSE1) consults the pre-VCD mapping tool provided by an
        European VCD service provider. Based on the information retrieved, the Austrian VCD implementation
        will deliver a VCD package containing all the evidences that are necessary to prove the selection and
        qualification criteria requested by any contracting authority regardless of its nationality (i.e. in the case
        of the scenario example provided in Figure 22: all evidences and declarations to be provided by TSE1,
        TSE2 and TSE3 to fulfil the requests of the Norwegian contracting authority).
        With this design concept, the Austrian pilot will implement a complex rule set that reflects the legal
        requirements regarding criteria and evidence selection determined in the EU-directive 2004/18/EC as
        well as in national implementations of this directive. This way, the Austrian VCD implementation will
        ensure full pan-European interoperability and will lead to a dynamic situation regarding the legal rule
        set and its flexibility to adapt to legal and organisational changes.
        In its implementation, the Austrian VCD pilot makes use of an execution engine directly interpreting an
        ontology representing the internationally agreed upon rules (coding of the rule set is avoided
        altogether). This ontology is the logic basis in order to orchestrate the necessary services collecting
        the required evidences for a given tender. Changes in the rule set will directly result in changes in the
        orchestration logic without any coding tasks and are executed immediately. Consequently, the
        implementation will be highly flexible and dynamic.
        <itemize>
          <item>UI/Workflow-System This component handles the interaction with the users of the system (e.g. requester of the VCD package) and copes with the necessary pan-European requirements regarding criterion selection, evidence selection and issuing service approval (including the interaction with the European VCD service provider regarding the pre-VCD mapping). The UI-component will provide the users with a web-client interface in order to support SMEs the best way possible.</item>
          <item>osSso Machine This component interprets the international rule set (ontology), generates a list of service to be called in order to furnish the required evidences for the given criteria and passes the resulting service chain to the SOA engine. The osSso machine is the core component of the Austrian VCD implementation and ensures the required flexibility described above through direct interpretation of the ontology without the need of programming. This component will be funded nationally outside the PEPPOL project.</item>
          <item>SOA Engine This component is in charge of calling the issuing service following the service chain, which has been constructed by the osSso machine. Part of the implementation will be the creation of issuing service profiles, which enable the integration of manual, semi-automated and automated Austrian issuing services. Due to the requirements of stage 3 regarding context-specific data this SOAengine strictly follows the design of the VCD advanced package data structures. To be as flexible as possible the data interchange protocols between the issuing services and engine itself will be based on international standards. The implementation of the SOA execution engine will also be an Austrian contribution to the WP2 implementation work funded nationally outside the PEPPOL project.</item>
          <item>VCD packager This component constructs the physical VCD package following the internationally agreed upon VCD advanced package design.</item>
        </itemize>
        The piloting approach is to change as few existing evidence issuing processes as possible in a first
        step, in order to quickly bring the VCD implementation into production. In a subsequent step, issuing
        services should be sequentially adapted to support automated data retrieval. This adaption will take
        place after the PEPPOL project.

      <title>Implementation approach</title>
      <text_body>
        Italy plans to adapt its current company’s dossier builder to the design and implementation principles
        set by PEPPOL WP2. This requires a set of actions in order to conform to the adopted standards and
        interoperability agreements of PEPPOL WP2. The interoperability dimension represents the challenge
        at the moment as very few transactions take place across borders and when they are performed they
        represent a heavy burden for those attending their execution.
        Italy is pressing on this by adopting different measures, i.e., by improving the organizational
        infrastructure, by offering better visibility of the involved organizations, by designing and developing
        policies that increase the trust among national and European organizations, by improving the
        information processing environment in order to reach the requirements set by the PEPPOL
        community.
        The conformance to PEPPOL’s WP2 interoperability standards will be approached by following the
        project agreed roadmap that includes the design and management of a dynamic knowledge base,
        known as the pre-VCD mapping tool and by implementing VCD services that conform to a multi-stage
        approach. For PEPPOL’s project runtime, Italy is planning to reach Stage 2 as ultimate stage in its
        system and services evolution along with solid contributions for the analysis and design of the upper
        level stages.
        The Italian implementation approach includes a long preparation activity that focuses more on legal
        investigation rather than technical engineering. Currently, the major challenge on interoperability
        across Europe comes from the persistent non homogeneous legal background and the reluctant
        attitude towards digital objects, mostly on electronic documents, digital identities and public registries.
        We see the two aspects, i.e. the legal and technical closely related, and aim at treating them with
        equal priority.
        Effort will be spent on refining and consolidating the document’s acquisition infrastructure that
        represents a multi-site networking system to reach the different certification authorities that are the
        authoritative suppliers of documents essential to the VCD package construction. A specific set of tasks
        will also address the transformation of evidences from the conventional form into an electronic form for
        computer assisted handling and management.
        As part of the interoperability dimension, there will be a supporting action for digging into existing
        certificates and dragging out of them the most valuable information.

  <title>Synthesis: Major interoperability requirements, SWOT and next steps</title>

  <title>Major requirements for VCD interoperability</title>
  <text_body>
    This section provides an overview about the deliverable and in particular about major requirements for
    VCD interoperability.
    The requirements and contents contained in chapters 2, 3 and 4 can be aggregated according to the
    following aspects:
    Level of support: The different levels of support address the maturity of the service and the maturity
    of the VCD package, where the former correspond to the functionalities (e.g. compilation support vs.
    recompilation support) provided and the latter corresponds to the semantic richness of the provided
    information (e.g. information support vs. decision support).
    Level of completeness: A VCD Package will show its full potential when all the requested
    attestations (all that are necessary to prove all requested criteria) are contained in it. The VCD
    promotes a step wise approach in order to reach a sufficient level of completeness by concentrating
    first on evidences with regard to Articles 45 – 46 and afterwards on evidences with regard to Articles
    47 – 50.
    Paradigm shift: The paradigm shift refers to the handling of documents to handling of information and
    electronic exchange of information in order to establish interoperability on the basis of mutual
    recognition. The VCD should encompass this change.
    Criteria for qualification and selection and non-exclusion: The criteria for qualitative selection and
    non-exclusion as defined in Article 45 to 50 of Directive 2004/18/EC are the common ground for
    building a cross border VCD service. Evidences will be connected to these criteria by further defining
    and grouping them into sub criteria and atomic criteria.
    Pre-VCD mapping tool: Provides a widely available tool which contains the up-to-date mappings of
    European criteria and evidences. The tool is build upon a basic semantic interoperability model
    consisting of relationships between evidences available in the Member States and European criteria of
    qualitative selection and exclusion (Superset). Tender specific requirements then have to be stated by
    contracting authorities according to the European criteria during notification phase in order to derive
    tender specific mapping results on evidences required to submit at tendering (Subset).
    VCD simple package: Establishment of a VCD system which consist of VCD services, hosted by a
    VCD service provider. VCD services are capable to collect evidences from different sources and
    compiling VCD packages from it. VCD simple package defines the structure of a package with regard
    to types of data.
    Types of data contained in a VCD: Provide the basis for a common structure of a VCD. Includes
    several data types (cf. ANNEX I – Glossary) to build the VCD from different sources and formats (e.g.
    tender specific data that refer to a particular Call for Tender, the evidences itself as electronic file or
    scanned copy and structural data of evidence that describe the evidences according to generic
    aspects).
    VCD advanced package: Introduces several additional VCD services that increase the level of
    support for the entities involved. Economic operators are for example enabled to maintain their data
    through re-compilation of a VCD or to merge their VCD with VCDs’ from other economic operators in
    order to create groups of economic operators for bidding consortia. VCD advanced package also
    introduces context specific data as additional type of data that describe the content of an attestation in
    a machine interpretable format.
    VCD networked package: Introduces “on-demand” retrieval of attestations that are sufficiently
    described through context specific data. The VCD networked package offers a good opportunity for a
    national service provider to establish official list of approved economic operators as foreseen in Article
    52 (1) of Directive 2004/18/EC. Therefore national service providers have to store attestations and
    referencing to it within the VCD. Contracting authorities are mandated to request attestations in
    individual cases (“on demand”) if they do not trust on the list of approved economic operators. The
    VCD networked package needs conflict resolution in cases of failure or system errors during “on
    demand” requests.
    Organisational Framework: Lists the requirements forming the organisational basis for implementing
    any of the VCD stages. They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are
    called organisational requirements for a VCD.
    Legal Framework: Lists the requirements forming legal basis for any VCD stage. They are
    independent of a particular VCD implementation or stage thus they are called legal requirements for a
    VCD.
    Semantic Framework: Lists the requirements which form the semantic basis for any of the VCD
    stages. They are independent of a particular implementation or stage thus they are called semantic
    requirements for a VCD.
    Technical Framework: Referring to the PEPPOL infrastructure. The technical framework lists several
    requirements that are essential to specify the technical (transportation and validation) basis in order to
    submit any WP2 solution across borders. They are independent of a particular implementation or
    stage thus they are called technical requirements for a VCD.
    In a next step these results will be transformed into a SWOT Analysis identifying the Strengths and
    Weaknesses of the proposed concept and its market opportunities.

    <title>VCD concept and its Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats</title>
    <text_body>
      SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses,
      Opportunities, and Threats of a project or intention. A SWOT analysis usually starts by defining an end
      state or objective which has been done for WP2 in chapter 2 and subsequent chapters. The aim of
      any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external factors that influence the achievements
      of this objective. SWOT analysis thereby groups key pieces of information into categories:
      <itemize>
        <item>Internal factors: The internal strengths and weaknesses of the proposed project.</item>
        <item>External factors: The opportunities and threats presented by the external environment to the project.</item>
      </itemize>
      The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon their impact on WP2
      objectives. What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses for
      another objective. The external factors may include market opportunities and threats, technological
      change, legislation, and political considerations23.
    </text_body>
    <p id="5.2.1">
      <title>Strength of the VCD concepts</title>
      <text_body>
        The major objective of this deliverable is to develop a concept for a VCD and to define major
        requirements that shape this VCD concept. Therefore we have defined different scenarios and a vision
        that contains several different levels of maturity. With the staged maturity model we intend to reach a
        wide flexibility and openness of such a solution encompassing all Member States to implement their
        individual preferences. Nevertheless the concept provides common grounds such as the pre-VCD
        mapping and structural data of evidences which ensures interoperability of evidences and their
        perception across borders. Beside we defined a set of requirements on organisational, semantic,
        technical and legal level that clarify general aspect of VCD development and deployment.
        To support the mutual recognition of evidences across border the VCD requires an underlying
        semantic model that enables a standardized classification and mapping between them (pre-VCD
        mapping tool). If the contracting authority specifies the relevant evidences which are related to criteria,
        the data can be processed automatically in order to look-up the evidences required within another
        Member State. The standard structure of the VCD, with the semantic enrichment of its structure then
        provides a European-wide understanding and format of company formal evidence.
        The different levels of maturity can be applied in dependence on the willingness and readiness of
        every Member State. The aim is to support basic interoperability and exchange of documents on the
        lower maturity levels and leading towards direct electronic exchange of evidence in the higher maturity
        levels. Thereby each maturity level is built upon the lower ones thus allowing integration and stepwise
        advancement.
        The VCD shall ensure that a significant part of the public procurement processes can be made
        through electronic cross-border transactions. Therefore the national focus of a VCD needs to be
        enhanced through a cross border perspective. The VCD will provide the possibility to utilize evidences
        used in one Member State and to submit them across borders to any European contracting authority.
        A VCD provides a single point of contact for an economic operator that enables him to invoke and
        manage different services to create a VCD. A service (re-)compiles the VCD package for the
        economic operator or even a group of economic operators. The VCD services merge data from
        several sources into a single container and make this data available and understandable to the actors
        involved. Economic operators will be enabled to perform checks with regard to the existence and
        validity of the requested evidences in the VCD package. Structural data of evidence will provide
        guidance for foreign contracting authorities to understand the evidences contained within a VCD and
        they can trust that general information since it is provided by national VCD service providers that take
        the role of trusted parties. Context specific data will be provided on the higher levels to increase
        decision support.
      </text_body>
    </p>
    <p id="5.2.2">
      <title>Weaknesses of a VCD</title>
      <text_body>
        There are also some weaknesses that can be identified for the overall concept. These weaknesses
        are mostly derived from the complexity of the domain and how the VCD solution reacts on this domain.
        One of the biggest weaknesses is probably the development of context specific data for the evidences
        within a VCD. The development of context specific data shall ensure the automatic processing of
        electronic attestations without regard to linguistic barriers. The development of standards and context
        specific vocabularies is time consuming and requires long term involvement of user groups that will
        make use of these standards. The VCD contains several different kinds of evidences and to develop
        common standards for each one cannot be a major task and focus of this work package and should be
        done by initiative such as CEN BII, BRITE, XBRL or ECRIS. Since CEN BII workshop is close to an
        end it will probably not work out to do this development within its scope. Nevertheless we will start to
        develop comm of contents and marginal variances in their contents. Furthermore we rely on structural
        data of evidences that describe and characterize evidence from a more generic point of view.
        The possibility to replace the full document translation with a “selective translation” through context
        specific data (keywords and major contents) bares certain risks. The “selective translation” could be
        arranged in multiple languages in particular when context specific data belongs to a common agreed
        dictionary of expressions. Nevertheless the acceptance of those selective translations instead of
        certified translations may be questionable for contracting authorities. Thus the resolution of language
        barriers and linguistic issues cannot be completely managed by a VCD in short term and may require
        adding official translations beside selective translations.
        Provision of context specific data is a precondition to establish direct information exchange between
        attestation providers and contracting authorities. This direct information exchange would provide many
        opportunities with regard to increase the actuality of evidence, to lower the transaction costs of the
        parties involved and to reduce the time to create a VCD. Nevertheless such direct exchange is very
        difficult to establish because a lot of entities and attestation services have to be federated, access
        policies have to be developed, legal uncertainties have to be resolved and political guidelines have to
        be considered. To circumvent these problems the VCD provides in particular in stage 4 a guideline on
        how to move forward in order to reach this ambitious aim but it will not be a major focus of a VCD as
        such.
        The VCD will be dependent on a number of services that rely on manual and semi-automated input.
        Thus the VCD system will be primary a tool for the economic operator to arrange a VCD package
        instance which is conform according to the requirements stated in particular call for tender which he
        can fill through additional inputs. A direct access to attestation via the national VCD service provider
        can only be provided for those public attestations that are already available in electronic format. The
        VCD will not enforce any development of electronic attestation on a national level as this is a clear
        national duty and is depended upon the development of context specific data. Nevertheless existing
        attestations may be extended through additional annotations that describe these documents
        generically (structural data of evidences).
        Unclear yet is the role of Member States that have already implemented Article 5224. The scope of
        mutual recognition needs to be further clarified with regard to acceptance of these procedures across
        borders and the liability of those trusted third parties across borders. It needs to be further defined how
        a VCD can support countries that have implemented Article 52 but since there are currently no pilots in
        our work package that have such procedures already implemented we have left this out of scope.
        Neverton representations (context specific data) for evidences that have an, easy structure,
        low quantityheless we see a great opportunity to combine both ideas as shown in stage 4.

      <title>Opportunities for a VCD in public procurement</title>
      <text_body>
        A major point of discussion in the domain is a sustainable and reliable long-term vision for exchanging
        attestations among Member States. In the long-run the VCD should be able to adequately fulfil the
        contracting authorities’ need to proof conformance to certain criteria for qualitative selection and
        exclusion while reducing the burden of proof for the Economic Operator. The costs of transaction of
        economic operators can be reduced through a single point of contact and through automatic
        arrangement of a VCD package instance according to the given criteria. Therewith manual comparison
        of tender specific requirements is being omitted. The same burden lays on contracting authorities who
        have to check for each evidence whether the issuer has appropriate rights within that country to
        provide evidence. Furthermore the possibility to re-use evidences that are still valid (time) and the
        maintenance of a VCD will again provide possibilities for cost reductions at the side of the economic
        operator.
        A paradigm shift towards electronic exchange of evidence and a next generation of attestations and
        certificates that are currently barely available in electronic form may be promoted by a VCD. At least
        the structural representation of attestation will provide benefit for the entities involved by providing
        transparency about the tendering requirements and the evidences that have to be submitted in cross
        border procedures. The pre-VCD mapping tool in particular will ensure transparency on cross border
        tendering requirements and will give indications about mutual recognition of evidences across borders.
        In contrast a VCD package contains the data necessary to prove the suitability of an economic
        operator according to these requirements. Therewith the VCD ease the overall procedure, may raise
        the number of cases of cross border procurements and may raise possibilities for greater competition
        across borders.

      <title>Threats for a VCD in public procurement</title>
      <text_body>
        Challenges to be dissolved when facing in particular the European perspectives of a VCD are
        mentioned by (Siemens_and_Time.lex 2008):
        <itemize>
          <item>organisational complexity e.g. the diversity of business certificates and attestations and the large amount of market players</item>
          <item>technical complexity e.g. several interoperability issues including standardisation, provision of agreed semantics, ease of deployment and the cross-border use of eSignatures, formats and protocols.</item>
          <item>legal issues e.g. validity of certificates and attestations, data protection, proof of authenticity and general legal requirements</item>
          <item>language barriers e.g. translation of business certificates and documents into the target language</item>
          <item>financial consequences e.g. infrastructure changes may raise the expenditures for the public sector</item>
          <item>political consideration e.g. procurement competences of Member States are often allocated on a decentralised level</item>
        </itemize>
        The creation of uniform infrastructure in this heterogeneous domain will take time since several
        different environments and stakeholders need to be involved and change may not be enforceable to
        all of them. In this respect the VCD should support current practices in exchanging evidence in the
        short-run and lead towards smooth, reliable and sustainable exchange of electronic evidence among
        Member States in the long-run.

    <title>Next steps in specification</title>
    <text_body>
      The requirements specification at hand lays the ground for further development towards a VCD. The
      report lists requirements that scope a potential solution according to the different levels of maturity and
      generic requirements. These requirements now have to be taken further into account in order to
      specify the VCD and implement the various stages. To facilitate management of the requirements,
      they will be transformed into a spreadsheet with information as shown in Table 11. A distinction will be
      made among functional requirements, non-functional requirements and requirements that specifically
      refer to the development process.
      The spreadsheet will be used in the project in order to maintain, adapt and perform change
      management to the requirements over the project lifetime. Maintaining them over the project lifetime
      will ensure that the requirements are complete, explicitly defined, clearly described, numbered and
      referenced. Further characteristics to evaluate the quality of requirements will be considered such as
      their determinability (atomic character), verifiability (well defined measurement towards the fulfilment of
      a requirement), traceability (tracking of complete fulfilment as well as of where a requirement emerged
      from) and consistency (conflicts between requirements such as contrary features or quality aspects).
      The requirements will be the basis for further development and will provide guidance and reference to
      subsequent activities. Taking the PEPPOL development infrastructure guidelines, SCRUM25 or the
      waterfall model (McDermind_and_Rook, 1991) as reference models, the next phase focuses now on
      the detailed design of the VCD concept as presented above. This phase will further detail the
      requirements through explicit models and artefacts that describe relevant process flows, data
      characteristics and software.
      Drafting agreed models requires interdisciplinary work between participants with different skills.
      Software engineers thereby may design a software model for the mapping of evidences together with
      legal experts that ensure the legitimacy of such a model. Furthermore we intend to work closely
      together CEN BII workshop and DG Markt (including Siemens and Time.lex) when drafting these models
      in order to ensure long term sustainability of the solution envisaged. The shared artefacts then can
      provide the basis for the implementation stage. They will also be fed back to the requirements and
      may enforce change to them.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <text_body>
    The report at hand aimed at documenting the functional and non-functional requirements for a Virtual
    Company Dossier. Departing from a description of the current procedure when economic operators
    collect the necessary evidences as proofs of selection and exclusion criteria in public tenders, the
    team of work package 2 has elaborated a four-stage vision for the VCD. This four-stage concept takes
    into consideration different strategies and levels of development in the provision of evidences within
    Member States. With the implementation of stage 1, the pre-VCD mapping, a first level of
    interoperability and facilitation to collect the necessary evidences for a public tender in another
    Member State is supported. The VCD concept, however, fosters higher maturity degrees, i.e.
    interoperability and facilitation for both, economic operators and procuring agencies through machinereadable
    and computable VCD packages containing the individual evidences.
    Throughout the analysis, elaboration and definition of the VCD concept plus the necessary research
    affiliated with this activity, fruitful insights could be collected about dependencies and
    interrelationships, which make this domain rather complex.
    The project team is aware of the fact that the VCD concept conceptualised in this report is rather
    generous – especially if we attempt to implement stage 4 of the VCD vision. A big step towards
    interoperability and cross-border facilitation in the collection of company information of economic
    operators can already be made when implementing the pre-VCD mapping tool.
    Consequently, a recommendation is given to focus implementation on the pre-VCD mapping tool for
    widespread application of a VCD at first hand. This very first level of interoperability and semantic
    mapping is the basis for the subsequent stages. Nonetheless, the big potentials of interoperability, of
    facilitation, of cost savings and of reduction of administrative burden lay in the implementation of
    stages 3 and 4. The two pilots scheduled within WP 2 will concentrate their efforts on these latter
    stages, and hence will evidence the potentials of these stages. They form the test cases for a wider
    rollout of the VCD concept as developed throughout phase 1 of work package 2 within PEPPOL.

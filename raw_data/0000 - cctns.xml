    INTRODUCTION
    </title>
    <text_body>
        The Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) report provides the detailed description of the functionalities required for the first version of the CCTNS. The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of “Investigation of Crime” and “Detection of Criminals”.

    FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
    </title>
    <text_body>
        CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed functionality of each block was determined.

    DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
    </title>
    <text_body>
       The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function.

        <title>
        Registration
        </title>
        <text_body>
        Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants.

        Investigation
        </title>
        <text_body>        
        After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration.

        <title>
        Prosecution
        </title>
        <text_body>
        Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.       
        </text_body>

        <title>
        Search
        </title>
        <text_body>
        The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc.        
        </text_body>

        <p id="">
        <title>
        Citizen Interface
        </title>
        <text_body>
        The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.        
        </text_body>

        <p id="">
        <title>
        Navigation
        </title>
        <text_body>
        The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.        
        </text_body>

        <p id="">
        <title>
        Application Configuration
        </title>
        <text_body>
        The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the states’ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, property information etc. can be created updated and deleted.
        The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate enclosures.

            Audit Module
        </title>
        <req id="1">
            <text_body>
                An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers. This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters. The System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about:
                <itemize>
                    <item>All the actions (create/read/update/delete) that are taken upon the critical entities (case, suspect, property,...) in the system
                    </item>
                    <item>The user initiating and or carrying out the action;</item>
                    <item>The date and time of the event.</item>
                    <item>Administrative parameters</item>
                </itemize>
                The word “unalterable” is to mean that the audit trail data cannot be modified in any way or deleted by any user; it may be subject to re-department and copying to removable media if required, so long as its contents remain unchanged.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="2">
            <text_body>
             Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="3">
            <text_body>
            The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="4">
            <text_body>
             The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made accessible, and that this can be achieved by authorised external personnel who have little or no familiarity with the system.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="5">
            <text_body>
             The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without affecting the audit trail stored by the System). This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="6">
            <text_body>
             The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e. A user’s attempts to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="7">
            <text_body>

        </req>
        <req id="6">
            <text_body>
            The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super-user.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="7">
            <text_body>
            If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses (selectable at configuration time):
            <itemize>
                <item>display title and metadata;</item>
                <item>display the existence of a case but not its title or other metadata;</item>
                <item>do not display any case information or indicate its existence in any way.</item>
            </itemize>
            These options are presented in order of increasing security. Note that the requirement in the third option (i.e. the most stringent) implies that the System must not include such cases in any count of search results; this level of security is normally appropriate for cases dealing with matters such as national security.
            </text_body>
        </req>
        <req id="8">
            <text_body>

Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.

            Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard.

           Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.

    FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
    </title>
    <text_body>
        The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies.
        The 3 C’s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition. The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary configuration changes. The customization layer can override and add to the core services based on the specific state requirements and can be plugged with the core services.
        The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be configured and customized as per the state specific extensions.
        The systems should be designed with the following broad guidelines:

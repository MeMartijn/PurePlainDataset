Maintenance level permits access to all subsystems for routine maintenance and diagnostic work. The telescope is typically at maintenance level during daylight (non-observing) hours; C.Test level.

This mode provides simple and safe access to the system for the collection of science data, selection of instrument parameters, and quick-look data reduction. Access to the system is through the sequencer with no direct control of telescope and instruments; B.Monitoring. This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be invoked on a subsystem basis. Under no circumstances should monitoring affect the performance of an ongoing observation; C.Operation. This is the access used for direct control of the telescope and instruments, typically during observation level operation. It is normally available only to the Telescope Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level; D.Planning. Access to the Gemini system is provided during science planning. Actual access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode, but the virtual telescope capability of the Gemini system provides a telescope simulator that is useful for planning observations, as are on-line databases; E.Testing. Test access allows full, direct control of any subsystem. All features of the subsystem are available in this mode.

       "  'Definition Observing astronomers are the end users of the system. They range greatly in experience from occasional users of the system to very experienced users such as staff astronomers at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site and service observers; Purpose of work Whatever their level of experience, observing astronomers will wish to concentrate on the efficient acquisition of astronomical data and on-line assessment of data quality, rather than on the details of controlling the telescope and instruments. To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use; Privileges Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned. They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time. The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. Programs, as opposed to observers, may have the capability of direct control of the telescope. This would allow the observer to create an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount. Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments, however; Operation mode Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation via an automatic sequencer. This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12). A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly. Observing commands will normally be submitted via the User interface to a queue for later execution. It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue. e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data. In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in Section 2.7 on page 2-12. It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive capability. However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation - such as focussing. The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on-site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation. Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become evident to the on site observer.',\n",

They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety; Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units. However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run; Operation mode Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of filters mounted on an instrument). Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area.

They also perform system generation and installation of new software packages or new releases, according to established test and validation procedures; Privileges Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able to modify everything in the system. Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation; Operation mode Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level (see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test. Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests. This means that a number of commands are available which allow the hardware concerned to be tested (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers.',\n",

Feeding two separate instruments via beam splitters or ﬁeld splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement. Various situations are possible for the other (inactive) instruments: they shall be able to take calibration or ﬂat ﬁeld exposures in parallel; they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation); they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels (observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3).',\n",

Due to the specialized nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted. In this case a subset of the available functionality must be made available through a standardized interface. The Gemini Telescopes view all instruments as operating as servers, responding to commands from the upper levels of the system. Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported. It should be the goal of this interface that it be a subset of the existing instrumentation interface (rather than a separate system). At a minimum this interface should support: acquisition of status information of instrument by other systems; capability to enter preprogrammed observing sequences; capability to offset the telescope position and focus.',\n",

In particular coordinated motions of the Gemini system components with those of the visitor instrument (other than simple raster scans) will not be supported. This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be possible for visitor instruments that require it. Such functionality will not be offered as a standard service but will require a joint effort on the part of Gemini and the visitor instrument team. As more complicated functionality will be supported via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments, such as coordinated motions, it should be possible to adapt visitor instruments to this standard. The difﬁculty with offering such services as an externally supported standard, as opposed to an internally supported standard, is that decisions to change internal standards do not impact external users. It is important that the visitor instrument interface be stable and long-lived, as the time between successive uses of the same visitor instrument can be as long as one or two years. The support of visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the visitor equipment adheres to the Gemini standards. However it must be recognized that: the Gemini standards may not prove cost effective for some visitor instruments; the Gemini standards will evolve over time as requirements and technology change; the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system; visitor instruments built later in time than the initial complement of Gemini instruments may want to take advantage of different and/or less expensive technology if it better suits the goals of their project.',\n",

It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be made available to visitor instruments via long lived, stable interfaces. Visitor requirements outside of these would be handled on an as needed basis. The support of both Gemini and visitor instruments would beneﬁt by the provision of a Gemini observatory simulator. This simulator, appearing to the instrument as a standard set of hardware and software interfaces, would present a functional deﬁnition of the observatory',\n",

By this it is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments. This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor. All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so. The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain difﬁcult or rare problems occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely. Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and investigate how the system is working (e.g. by selecting different display pages with the up-to-date status information on different parts of the system). Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote supervisor.

This includes managing the collection of science, environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data; To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments. These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences. It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue. This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established by the observatory directorate.While these rules have yet to be worked out one could imagine rules such as “no more than 15% of observing will be preempted” or “a 10% overhead to the prime observing project is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the sky with identical ﬁlters”.',\n",

But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most efﬁcient way to achieve this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning and test periods). Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing program can be performed by someone other than the proposing astronomer. It will be done on his behalf at a convenient moment that is not exactly predeﬁned and may be intermixed with programs from other users. Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments. This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change. It requires also that the observing program is so well speciﬁed that it can be executed by someone else. In other words, it requires a computer executable observing program. Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and ﬁrst of all, considerable experience with a smooth running system. For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been fulﬁlled and been in operation for a while. Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement',\n",

At the same time, one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra ﬂexibility of ground-based astronomy.

This can be complemented by remote monitoring, if users can be on standby at a suitably equipped remote site. Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly, exchanging observing programs. This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software, which must advise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs. It should be recognized that such ‘expert scheduling’ software does not currently exist - it should be a requirement of such software that it have an operational mode which merely supports the decision making process by presenting appropriate information.

Access to control parameters, telescope and instrument information for monitoring or other use makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the control ﬂow, and may be logged at quite high rates for short periods (i.e. up to 200 Hz for some information). It is explicitly required that all such information is available to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software and is capable of being available to all users of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, subject only to restrictions with respect to updating.

Quick-look data processing should be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, with procedures suitable for fast on-line data preprocessing. A prerequisite for this is that acquired data are made available as directly as possible in a common format, and that all additional data related to an exposure and logging information are made available on-line at the same time. Quick-look should be usable within exposure sequences to provide results and feedback parameters to the control software in a programmed way, without the need for manual intervention. This document does not try to be speciﬁc about the requirements for Quick-look other than that it should be synchronous. Near-line processing should be available for simple data reductions required for data integrity validation (i.e. remove instrument and observatory effects so the observer can make decisions about further observing actions). This data reduction proceeds sequentially through requests, but asynchronously from data acquistion. In particular, data acquisition takes precedence over near-line data reduction. Off-line pixel processing for full data reduction should also exist at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, but does not have any interface to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. The Astronomical communities have made considerable investments in image processing software, and therefore, compatibility with and adaptations to these packages must be sought. EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS It should also be noted that some Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystems, such as adaptive optics, may require their own special on-line pixel processing software, which is better deﬁned in the requirements for those subsystems. This is largely due to the difﬁculty of applying on-line the same algorithms used for full off-line reductions — in general due to the time critical nature of the image processing needs. The same situation might also occur with other instruments, where speciﬁc observer support software has to be foreseen for on-line use. In all these cases the speciﬁc on-line (quick-look) software development shall be seen as a subset of the development for the off-line data reduction system, to avoid as far as possible duplication of development effort.',\n",

Independently of the physical layout of such a network, its functional requirements can be split into several categories: Local coordination and synchronization needs within a subsystem (for example, coordination of active support system for primary mirror, bi-directional trafﬁc of commands/replies). This layer could be considered as internal to a given subsystem or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique solution at the hardware and software level; Global synchronization needs, such as the universal time synchronization requirement.

For maintenance reasons and hardware independence, a clear hierarchical model must be implemented, supporting separation of logical and physical layers, e.g. ISO/OSI model. It is recognized that this hierarchy may need to be violated for (in general) performance reasons. This results in point-to-point connections between peer systems or direct connections bypassing the hierarchy. Network redundancy should also be considered in the design phase as a way to increase reliability and security, in particular for control information. Due to the uncertain future of the Internet, only non-essential tasks may employ it. All essential tasks, not including remote observing, must take place on resources controlled by the project (such as leased lines). Violation of the hierarchical nature of the system can lead to testing and maintenance problems. The use of these features must be limited and constrained by the following guidelines: Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated performance problem; Bypassing the hierarchy (connected between grandmother and granddaughter with no path through the mother) should only be used for transmission of status information or bulk data, not control ﬂow.',\n",

Finally, in the case of remote operations, other users (e.g. support staff) might be on Cerro Tololo or in Hilo.

It is acceptable, and may well prove to be the best solution, to provide intrusion security by a well designed network gateway acting as a ﬁrewall. A system that is operating in Engineering/Maintenance mode must ignore directives from other systems, though status information should still be provided for use by other systems. There should be security preventing the intrusion into the system by unauthorized users, or users at unauthorized access levels. All systems are appropriately interlocked. This interlock must not depend on any software for reliable operation. Details of the interlock system are found in the Mount Control System Work Package Deﬁnition. The interlock philosophy is as follows: All hazards capable of causing death and/or loss of irreplacable equipment shall be passively interlocked; All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be actively interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level; All other hazards may be interlocked via software.',\n",

Normal operation is possible at all operation levels (observing, maintenance, and test) and applies to the following conditions (where appropriate) on any subsystem: Observing; Stand-by; Maintenance and testing. Performance. Overall performance of the Gemini telescope is deﬁned as the percentage of viewable time during which exposures have been taken (i.e. sum of all exposure times over available time for exposures). To improve this performance, all possible concurrencies in system operation should be used. Best use of concurrency occurs when using the Sequencer; Start-up and shut-down. There are start-up and shut-down procedures that must exist at many different levels: Cold start-up, starting the system from scratch (including time to download all software) should take about 5 minutes.

       "  'Fault-tolerance and recovery See Attributes, Section 4.1 on page 4 - 1; Error logging. There are three types of errors: Fatal Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will allow operation to proceed. Under fatal error conditions, the system falls back to a safe \"backup\" state requiring human intervention for restart; Serious Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but the current operation cannot be completed. Serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation; Warning All other unexpected conditions result in warnings that are properly logged. The system continues operation, though perhaps with reduced efﬁciency. All subsystems must group errors into these categories. In addition, errors that result in an \"alarm\" should be described, along with the proper action required to acknowledge and eliminate the alarm condition. Besides the time-stamp, error logging should provide enough information to trace the condition back to its apparent source, both in equipment and in event sequence. There should be tools available to extract error (and other) logging information by subsystem component, time- sequence, previous events, and so on. The Gemini Control System formally distinguishes alarms from errors. Errors result from failures to successfully complete commands, while alarms represent asynchronous failures. Note that an error may result in an alarm.There are two types of alarm conditions. The ﬁrst are automatically monitored alarms, which exist as long as the errors persist and are then automatically cleared. The second type of alarm require human acknowledgment to clear. Recovery In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-deﬁned recovery procedures for any subsystem that has become inoperative. Command retries must be included in the system for most common timeouts or noresponse conditions. These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid unnecessary error conditions; Performance The performance of error-mode recovery is speciﬁc to the subsystem and is deﬁned in the Functional speciﬁcation for that subsystem. Normally, there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut-down and then restart the subsystem. However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations that do not require that particular instrument; For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded performance. For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking; other errors may result in operation with a different instrument; Under normal conditions, the number of warnings should be small. The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase might indicate that some tuning or maintenance is appropriate. Ideally, such conditions should be noted by the subsystems before reaching the OCS level; Failure conditions should not cascade. That is, failure of one subsystem should not affect other, working, subsystems, including communication links.',\n",

       "  'Database The heart of an IOC is a memory resident database together with various memory resident structures describing the contents of the database. EPICS supports a large and extensible set of record types, e.g. ai (Analog Input), ao (Analog Output), etc. Each record type has a ﬁxed set of ﬁelds. Some ﬁelds are common to all record types and others are speciﬁc to particular record types. Every record has a record name and every ﬁeld has a ﬁeld name. The ﬁrst ﬁeld of every database record holds the record name, which must be unique across all IOCs attached to the same TCP/IP subnet. A number of data structures are provided so that the database can be accessed efﬁciently. Most software components, because they access the database via database access routines, do not need to be aware of these structures; Databases Access With the exception of record and device support, all access to the database is via the channel or database access routines; Databases Scanning Database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process a record. Four types of scanning are possible: Periodic, Event, I/O Event, and Passive. Periodic: A request can be made to process a record periodically. A number of time intervals are supported. Event: Event scanning is based on the posting of an event by any IOC software component. The actual subroutine call is: post_event(event_num) I/O Event: The I/O event scanning system processes records based on external interrupts. An IOC device driver interrupt routine must be available to accept the external interrupts. Passive: Passive records are processed as a result of linked records being processed or as a result of external changes such as channel access puts; Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers In order to remove record speciﬁc knowledge from database access, each record type has an associated record support module. Similarly, in order to remove device speciﬁc knowledge from record support, each record type can have a set of device support modules. If the method of accessing hardware is complicated, a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules. Many record types, in particular all types not associated with hardware, do not have device support or drivers. The IOC software is designed so that the database access layer knows nothing about the record support layer other than how to call it. The record support layer in turn knows nothing about it’s device support layer other than how to call it. Similarly the only thing a device support layer knows about it’s associated driver is how to call it. This design allows a particular installation and even a particular IOC within an installation to choose the set of record types, device types, and drivers it wishes to use. The remainder of the IOC system software is unaffected. Every record support module must provide a record processing routine. It is this routine that is called by the database scanners. Record processing consists of some combination of a standard set of functions; Databases Monitors The routines described in this section provide a callback mechanism for database value changes. This allows the caller to be notiﬁed when database values change without constantly polling the database. A mask can be set to specify value changes, alarm state changes, and/or archive changes. At the present time only channel access uses database monitors. No other software should use the database monitors. Because they are of interest only to channel access, the monitor routines will not be described.',\n",

Each IOC provides a channel access server which is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients. Channel access client services are available on both OPIs and IOCs. A client can communicate with an arbitrary number of servers. It should be noted that channel access does not provide access to database records as records. This is a deliberate design decision. This allows new record types to be addedwithout impacting any software that accesses the database via channel access. A channel access client can communicate with multiple IOCs having differing sets of record types.',\n",

Speciﬁcally, the IOC core software is almost exclusively in the domain of the Los Alamos AOT-8 ofﬁce. Two major ﬂavors of development tools are in use with support coming from key groups within Los Alamos and Argonne. Many sites contribute custom CA client tools as this generally involves C or C++ programming under a UNIX O/S to interface to the standard CA library. In addition, many sites create their own database record types and new device support and driver layers. Although there is presently a large amount of activity in the enhancement of EPICS Internals software especially in the ﬁelds of non-IOC core software, this is an order of magnitude less than the amount of Applications work under way at over 20 distinct programs.',\n",
       "  'Another large group of predominately Applications developers that are starting work are the Collaborative Access Teams (CATS) at Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS).The APS is a facility to produce high brilliance X-rays for a variety of experiments and includes 36 experimental halls with 2 lines each. As of March 1994, there were 15 CATS at the APS with most CATS responsible for a single sector (2 beamlines). Each CAT has its own funding for designing/building/operating the physical beamline, instrumentation, controls, and data acquisition systems. Because the experimental areas must be coordinated with the main facility control system and since 25% of the beamtime must be made available to independent investigators it was strongly recommended that EPICS be used as the toolkit for all CATS development work. Not only would this simplify the integration with the central control system but would also provide a common environment for facility visitors. Typically, each CAT has 1 or 2 developers, and the major focus is not on the IOC software although some new records, like the Multichannel Analyser, have been created, but rather on the OPI CA client applications. Heavy use is being made of both Tcl/TK and IDL to support high-level sequencing and data reduction. This is similar to the Gemini architecture as the bulk of the control system intelligence is contained within OPI CA client tasks. Other items of concern are: Different science programs in use at each CAT which have complex associated data acquisition and reduction routines; The creation of large data sets; Simultaneous local and remote monitoring and intervention; Ease of use for one-time users; Data export to home institutions.',\n",

It is anticipated that all other IOC-related work packages will be performing exclusively Applications work. In the advent of future work packages requiring Internals work it is planned the RGO SIC development staff will be made available. In this way the number of Internals staff is kept at a minimum.',\n",
       "  \"There are several means of transmitting commands and data across the Gemini system: Direct A command source may directly specify the target subsystem. This is the most common means of command transfer from the Observatory Control System to the subsystems; Channel Commands and data may be routed through a channel. This mechanism requires that some (unknown to the source) target subsystem has been attached to the channel as the target. It is possible that the channel is 'intelligent', in the sense that data may be converted from one form to another during transmission. This might be implemented by connecting two channels with a conversion module. An example of a channel connection might be the data stream between the A&G system and the Primary Mirror Control System. The A&G might be transmitting Zernickes to the PMCS, which is receiving Shack- Hartmann data. The intelligent channel would be responsible for the conversion. It is possible that a channel have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both! Finally, a channel might use a separate physical route, to prevent large data transmissions (say) from interfering with the 'normal' command streams; Broadcast Some commands and data signals are simply broadcast across the control system. Any subsystem may examine these communications and respond or ignore as appropriate. For example, the OCS might broadcast a RunTest command, causing all subsystems to perform self-testing. As another example, a critical system failure might cause a ShutDown command to be broadcast.\",\n",
       "  'All commands contain the same general structure: Identiﬁcation: Command_ID; Source; Target. The Command_ID is an identiﬁcation that is unique to that speciﬁc instance of each command. A portion of the ID is monotonically increasing and functions as a timestamp for journalling and tracing. This is to be implemented using a technique analogous to the CFHT odometer. The Source and Target ﬁelds indicate the originator and the recipient for the command, as expected. The Target may be a speciﬁc recipient, a Channel, or simply a Broadcast, but the Source is always the origination point of the command. Istruction: Opcode; Parameter set.

Not all status levels are reachable through SetStatus; SetConfigurations This command directs the downloading of a conﬁguration from the host to the target subsystem. It is important that care be taken to avoid conﬁguration values that would result in motion, etc. This command can operate with the GetConﬁguration command given above to provide 'sequencing points' for subsystem restarts or roll backs; RunTest.

The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission on to any other subject; Dynamically Generated Processing: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent upon information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved; Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system. For example, a view that joins table data from several databases provides location transparency because the user of the view does not need to know where the data originates from; Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Imediates access to an object based on the clearance level of the subject (user) and the sensitivity label of the object. (These controls are always enforced above any discretionary control implemented by users); Mirrored Databases: Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS RDBMS own system utilities and operating system; Object: A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields, processors, video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, and network nodes; Proponent Scheme: Describes the sites at which databases are replicated and also who owns and has update authority with respect to the data at each site. It refers to proponency at the source and record level; Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears as one very large, reliable disk to the CPU. The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability. RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost. There are several types/levels of RAID implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across all data disks and adds a parity value to a separate disk for recovery if any disk fails, RAID 4 (in which data is distributed in large chunks across all data disks and also has a single parity disk. RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers. RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance). In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array. If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data. Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability; Remote Data Access (RDA): is an ISO (9579) application layer interoperability standard (protocol and formats) to support access by an application to a (remote) DBMSs over an OSI network. The goal of RDA is to allow interoperability between applications (clients) and databases (servers) of different manufacturers so that an application is able to read and update data in remote databases via well defined standards. RDA defines a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services. RDA also defines an interface to ISO (transaction processing) two phase commit TP services in the case where updates to multiple remote databases need to be coordinated. RDA does not yet define interoperability between server databases (i.e. it is not yet a standard for distributed database management); Replication Scheme: Information that precisely identifies DBs, or partitions of DBs, to be copied and/or distributed, replication schedules, and master/remote sites that are to receive the copies; Spatial DBMS: Geographic information system that organizes and maintains spatial data (i.e. data with graphical attributes) in terms of type, scale, location(s), extent, topology and geometry. Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are defined by spatial attributes; SRI: A Standing Request For Information (SRI) is a capability in which CASS monitors for the occurrence of conditions established by an application program, and notifies the calling or establishing application program when the conditions are satisfied. An SRI may be one of three types: timer-based, data-based, or message-based; Subject: An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state. Technically, a process/domain pair; Transaction Journalling: Individual messages or database transactions are stored in a journal file, which may be a linear log file or a circular file.\",\n",
       "  'The metadata and procedures are described for the current Information Resource Submittal Package . Metadata and Related Information An XML tag may be described as any object and is easily created by anyone using a text editor. Although XML is a relatively new technology, many developers are already using XML in operational COE systems and have already created tags and specifications, many of which may be inconsistent with tags used in other systems. So far, the burgeoning sets of XML tags have created redundancy and irrelevancy, and they lack validity; XML Registry. To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community. The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your requirements. The Registry has a substring search capability so that the user may easily find information resources that meet the criteria. The user may specify whether to search for the term within the name of the information resource or the definition or both; Developer\\'s Role. Developers are urged to review the baseline tags, adopt them where possible, and subscribe to future notifications about the tags. If, after reviewing the tags in the Registry, you cannot reuse an existing specification (a.k.a. Document Type Definition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your proposed tag to a Community of Interest (COI) and provide amplifying information for all to understand the semantics for its proper use; COE Chief Engineer\\'s Role. The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) for a COI to manage the tags within that COI. The COE Chief Engineer will reserve ultimate authority to mediate any unresolved disputes within all COIs; The COE Data Engineering Team\\'s Role. Tags and semantics will be analyzed to identify opportunities to consolidate tags towards a single or a minimal number of representations. A \"market forces\" model can also guide COE Data Engineering in identifying the weak candidates from the strong.8; The Community of Interest\\'s POC\\'s Role. (The information in the following section is current as of 17 May, 1999. Please consult the Registry for the most authoritative list of information resources types.) The POC responsibilities will include the transitioning of information resources from one status to another. Table 1 lists the valid types of information resources. The status levels are developmental, candidate, approved, rejected, and retired.',\n",

Example: CTRY_CD, CTRY_NM, CTRY_ABBRD_NM, CTRY_OFF_NM, CTRY_SCP_NT_TX, and CTRY_PSTL_NM are all characteristics (ER-attributes) for the entity CTRY. In the relational world, they are columns within the table ctry, attributes of the entity ctry in er-modeling, and member attributes in object modeling. It would be expected that a submitter would identify them as attributes rather than elements. But if they were identified as attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be carried, or submitted as separate elements. We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly.',\n",
